export const text = `Perceived social isolation or connectedness can produce changes in the cells of our immune system. Throughout history, human survival has been threatened by the various bacteria and viruses that try to make us their home. The bacteria-driven Black Death decimated Europe between 1346 and 1400, killing an estimated 30 to 60% of the population (Austin Alchon, 2003). Smallpox, measles, and influenza carried by Europeans to the Western Hemisphere killed as many as 90% of native populations (Public Broadcasting Service [PBS], 2005). The Spanish flu of 1918, which is related to contemporary bird flu strains, killed between 50 million and 100 million people worldwide in about a year (Patterson & Pyle, 1991). Although you might think surviving a pandemic is more a question of biology and medicine, behavior and mental processes have a considerable amount of influence on our abilities to fight bacteria and viruses (Cacioppo & Berntson, 2011). Again, zooming out to the human social environment and then zooming back in to a smaller scale gives us a complete and interesting picture. Humans, who lack impressive teeth or claws, formed groups to enhance the odds of their survival. Anyone who was socially excluded from these groups experienced a more hostile environment. Social exclusion not only separated a person from the help of others in life-threatening situations, perhaps in fending off a predator, but worse, could lead to outright conflict with others, including combat. Under such hostile circumstances, socially excluded people faced a greater risk from bacterial infections than from viruses. Bacteria enter the body through cuts and scratches, whereas viruses are transmitted through body fluids (e.g., sneezing), so you are most likely to be exposed to them when you are in close contact with other people. Human brains such as this one, carefully held by one of your authors, weigh about 3 pounds and contain approximately 86 billion neurons. That’s about the same number as the stars in our galaxy, the Milky Way. With that background in mind, look at the group of people in the image on the previous page. Do you think the woman on the left is feeling included or excluded? Surprisingly, whether we typically feel socially isolated or socially connected can have serious implications for our health (Cole et al., 2015). If this woman normally feels isolated and often left to fend for herself, she will, like her excluded ancestors, face a greater threat from bacteria than from viruses. Her brain will respond to her feelings of isolation by generating hormonal signals that will tell her immune system (shown in the larger image at the beginning of the chapter) to gear up to protect her against bacteria. In contrast, if she usually feels socially connected to others, her brain will initiate a cascade of hormonal signals that tell her immune cells to prepare to protect her against viruses. This is just one example of how the mind’s perceptions of the social environment—whether it is friendly or not, for instance—can affect biological processes that are important to health and survival. In Chapter 3, we learned how the challenges of surviving and reproducing in particular physical and social environments could shape a species’ biology and behavior. In turn, the resulting biological structures and processes of the mind exert profound influences on our physical and social environments. In this chapter, we will provide a foundation for understanding the biological bases of behavior and mental processes by exploring the structures of the nervous system and the ways that they function.Many of us find the concept that our minds are somehow a result of the activity of nerve cells a bit unsettling. How could our feelings, thoughts, and memories be caused by a bunch of cells? Shouldn’t there be more to who we are than something so physical? Such ideas led thinkers like Renaissance philosopher René Descartes to propose a philosophy of dualism, which suggests that our mind is somehow different and separate from our physical being. If you are more comfortable with thinking about mind this way, go ahead, as long as you recognize that the field of biological psychology, and the neurosciences in general, embrace the competing philosophy of monism. According to the monistic approach, the mind is what the brain does. Biological psychology, also known as behavioral neuroscience, is the scientific study of the reciprocal connections between the structure and activity of the nervous system and behavior and mental processes. Biological changes often influence behavior and cognition. For example, when your stomach is empty, a gut hormone called ghrelin is released. When ghrelin reaches the brain, you respond by feeling hungry. After you eat, ghrelin release is suppressed and you feel satisfied, so biology (amount of ghrelin released) initiates behavior and cognitions (feeling hungry and beginning to eat, or feeling full and stopping eating). However, your behavior and cognitions can also have substantial effects on your biology. When participants were told that the 380-calorie milkshake that they consumed was a sensible 140-calorie shake, their ghrelin levels barely changed, whereas consuming the same 380-calorie milkshake was followed by a steep decrease in ghrelin when they were told it was a 620-calorie indulgent shake (Crum, Corbin, Brownell, & Salovey, 2011). In other words, the way people thought about the shake (cognitions) had remarkable effects on their biology (amount of ghrelin released). We can’t guarantee that praising your healthy salad for its indulgent qualities will make it easier to stick to your diet, but the milkshake experiment reinforces the power of thought to influence biology. Consistent with our argument that multiple perspectives considered together produce a richer and more accurate analysis of the mind, we would like to introduce you to a combination of two seemingly distant fields—culture and neuroscience—to form cultural neuroscience. Cultural neuroscience has been defined as an interdisciplinary field that examines how cultural and biological mechanisms mutually shape human behavior across phylogenetic, developmental, and situational timescales (Chiao, 2015, p. 283). In other words, cultural neuroscientists explore how genetics, brain structures, and cultures interact to shape behavior (see Figure 4.1). Scientists working in the new discipline of cultural neuroscience argue that brain activity can be different when people of different cultures complete the same task. Here participants undergoing brain imaging were asked to think about their own traits (self), their mother’s traits (mother) and a famous person’s traits (other). Both American and Chinese participants showed more activation in relevant areas of the brain in response to thinking about themselves versus thinking about the other famous person, but their responses to their mothers differed. The Chinese did not show different patterns of activity when thinking about themselves and their mothers, but the Americans did. Cultural neuroscience asks two main questions. First, how do cultural phenomena such as beliefs and values influence genetics and brain structures? We saw an example of this question in our discussion of the Waorani and Yanomamö tribes in Chapter 3. The Yanomamö cultural value of standing down between raids, not shared by the Waorani, led to changed reproductive success on the part of the most aggressive Yanomamö warriors. Among the Yanomamö, the most aggressive men had the most children, while among the Waorani, the least aggressive men had the most children. In other words, a difference in cultural values influenced the genetic make-up of subsequent generations of these groups. The second question asks how genetics and brain structure shape cultural phenomena. At a minimum, we might argue that forming cultures is something the human brain always seems to do. You will read about more specific examples of this type of process later in the textbook. In Chapter 12, we explore evidence suggesting that cultures with fewer individuals carrying the SS SERT genotype (also discussed in Chapter 3) are more likely to be individualistic than cultures where the SS genotype is more typical. Not only can our biology affect our behavior, but our behavior and cognitions can have significant effects on our biology as well. When Alia Crum and her colleagues made participants think they were drinking an indulgent milkshake instead of a sensible milkshake, their levels of the hormone ghrelin were more consistent with feelings of satisfaction.Advances in the methods we use to observe the structure and function of the nervous system have driven the history of biological psychology. The development of contemporary methods, such as the recording and imaging of brain activity, opened new areas of inquiry to biological psychologists. Before these methods were available, however, most of our knowledge of the nervous system resulted from clinical observations of injured or mentally ill individuals or from autopsy, the examination of bodies after death. When used with other contemporary methods, clinical observation and autopsy are quite accurate, but early thinkers lacking contemporary methods often struggled in their attempts to understand the physical basis of mind. They understood many things correctly while making some notable errors. Aristotle (384–322 BCE) mistakenly believed that the heart, not the brain, was the source of mental activity. An interesting historical mistake was phrenology. Toward the end of the 18th century, phrenologists proposed that the pattern of bumps on an individual’s skull correlated with that person’s personality traits and abilities (Simpson, 2005). The brain supposedly worked like a muscle, getting larger through use, which led frequently used areas of the brain to grow so much that the skull above these areas would bulge. Phrenologists read a person’s character by locating the bumps on a person’s head and identifying the personality traits below each bump according to a map. None of these ideas were close to being accurate. Although the phrenologists were wrong about the significance of bumps on the skull and the effects of activity on the structure of the brain, they did reach one correct conclusion: Their notion that some behavioral functions are localized to certain areas of the brain is one we share today.More modern perspectives of the nervous system emerged from the work of scientists such as Nobel Prize–winning anatomist Santiago Ramón y Cajal (1852–1934) and neurologist John Hughlings Jackson (1835–1911). Ramón y Cajal’s work helped us understand the microscopic level of the nervous system, while Jackson’s conclusions illuminate the relationships among the larger structures of the brain. Surprisingly, it took scientists a long time to accept the idea that the nervous system was made up of separate cells just like other tissues in the body. Even in the late 19th century, scientists such as Camillo Golgi still argued that the nervous system was a single continuous network. Ironically, Ramón y Cajal used a microscopic stain invented by Golgi to prove him wrong. Using Golgi’s stain, Ramón y Cajal demonstrated conclusively that the nervous system was made up of separate cells, an idea that became known as the Neuron Doctrine. Both men shared the 1906 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Phrenologists believed that reading the bumps on a person’s head, using a bust like this as a reference, could tell them about a person’s character. Based on observations of his patients with seizure disorders, Jackson proposed that the nervous system is organized as a hierarchy, with progressively more complicated behaviors being managed by more recently evolved and complex structures (Jackson, 1884). We can see Jackson’s hierarchy at work when we observe people drinking alcohol. Alcohol specifically decreases the activity of parts of the brain involved with decision making. When a person has had too much to drink, the more complex social controls (e.g., knowing how close you should stand to a stranger) normally provided by higher level areas of the brain are diminished. Without the influence of these controls, people start doing things that they would not do while sober. This change in behavior reflects the now-unrestrained influence of the more primitive parts of the brain involved with behaviors such as aggression and sexuality. You might, for example, pick a fight with someone when you normally think fighting is wrong. The aggression and sexuality were there all along, but the activity of the higher levels of the nervous system usually restricted their expression to more appropriate circumstances (Siever, 2008). Over the last 100 years, our understanding of the correlations between brain and behavior leaped forward with continuing improvements in research methods, including many of those found in Table 4.1. In particular, methods that allow scientists to observe the activity of the living brain, including positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), began to answer questions that were impossible to study previously. While these imaging technologies are still far away from mind reading, researchers have been able to use imaging data to identify the visual content of a participant’s dreams (Horikawa, Tamaki, Miyawaki, & Kamitani, 2013) and distinguish between images remembered from one’s own experience and similar but novel images (Rissman, Chow, Reggente, & Wagner, 2016).

What behavioral changes are correlated with brain damage?This functional magnetic resonance image (fMRI) was taken while one of your authors engaged in a finger-tap exercise, touching each digit of her right hand one by one with her thumb for 20 seconds followed by holding very still for 20 seconds. The red and yellow areas indicate parts of her brain that were selectively more active during the finger-tapping task than when she tried to stay very still. Moving into the 21st century, the ranks of neuroscientists continue to grow, from 500 members of the Society for Neuroscience in 1969 to more than 40,000 members today (Society for Neuroscience, 2016). Many departments of psychology have added phrases such as and neuroscience, and behavioral neuroscience, or and brain sciences to their names. In 1986, only seven universities in the United States offered undergraduate degrees specifically in neuroscience (Ramos et al., 2011). That number tripled by 1996 and more than tripled again by 2006. It is very likely that your college or university psychology department offers a number of courses in neuroscience, and you might have a separate major or minor as well. As more scientists are trained in the neurosciences, we can look forward to continued innovations in both technology and our knowledge about the biological basis of mind. Reductionism in science is defined as the explanation of complex things as sums of simpler things. Taking a rather extreme reductionist approach, science fiction often features scenes in which an android reminds a human that they’re not so different after all—the brain is just a computer made up of chemicals, nothing more, nothing less. In some ways, all modern science is reductionist. Scientists assume that whether you are studying particle physics or human behavior, a single set of fundamental laws explains much of what we observe. We do not need new sets of rules for the features of table salt (sodium chloride) in each context in which it appears. Regardless of whether the chemical is participating in neural signaling, flavoring our food, contributing to high blood pressure, or making us float more easily when we swim in the ocean, the fundamental principle is the same: Salt is salt. The scientific search for fundamental principles has been fruitful, but it does have limitations. Although we can learn a lot by breaking apart complex things to study simple things, we saw some risks to this approach in the debates between structuralists and Gestalt psychologists, described in Chapter 1. Fish swim in schools, geese fly in a V formation, ants and bees swarm, cattle form herds, and humans form societies. We could never understand these complex phenomena by studying the behavior of an individual member of the group. Nobel laureate physicist P. W. Anderson (1972, p. 393) reminded scientists that large collections of simple things do not always behave in the same way that simple things behave in isolation. He wrote that at each stage (of complexity), entirely new laws, concepts, and generalizations are necessary, requiring inspiration and creativity to just as great a degree as in the previous one. Psychology is not applied biology, nor is biology applied chemistry. This chapter on the biological foundations of behavior and mental processes relies extensively on reductionist thinking. As you work through the chapter, however, it is important to keep Anderson’s cautions in mind. Some aspects of behavior will continue to be governed by rules that explain the actions of simple things, while others will require the introduction of rules better suited to more complex combinations and interactions of simple things. Viewing a complex concept as a sum of its simpler parts is not always the best way to understand its full meaning.To examine the relationships between nervous system and behavior, we will first zoom out to examine the larger view of the structures making up the nervous system, and then we’ll zoom in later in the chapter to look at the microscopic world of the nerve cells, or neurons. Talking about the connections between structures of the nervous system and behavior requires a quick word of caution. As mentioned in Chapter 3, saying that we have a gene for a behavior is overly simplistic. Saying we have a center for a behavior in the brain is equally misleading. Although we can identify structures that participate in certain behaviors, the biology of mind involves intricate and overlapping patterns of activity involving networks made up of richly connected structures. The nervous system can be divided into two major components: the central and the peripheral nervous systems (PNS) (see Figure 4.2). The central nervous system (CNS)The central nervous system (CNS)The brain and spinal cord.            The central nervous system (CNS)        The brain and spinal cord.             consists of the brain and the spinal cordspinal cordA long cylinder of neural tissue extending from the medulla of the brain down to the middle of the back; part of the central nervous system            spinal cord        A long cylinder of neural tissue extending from the medulla of the brain down to the middle of the back; part of the central nervous system            , which extends from the brain down the back of the body. Although we often see the brain and the spinal cord referred to as separate structures, they form one continuous unit of tissue. You might think of the brain as having a tail known as the spinal cord. Nerves branch outward from the CNS to all areas of the body—the lungs, heart, and other organs; the eyes and ears; and the arms, legs, fingers, and toes. As soon as a nerve branches outward from the CNS, it is considered part of the peripheral nervous system (PNS)peripheral nervous system (PNS)The nerves exiting the central nervous system that carry sensory and motor information to and from the rest of the body            peripheral nervous system (PNS)        The nerves exiting the central nervous system that carry sensory and motor information to and from the rest of the body            . Another way to know you have left the CNS for the PNS is to look for the protection of bone. Nerves of the CNS are encased in bone, but those of the PNS are not. The nervous system has two major divisions: the CNS, containing the brain and the spinal cord, and the PNS, containing all nerves that exit the brain and the spinal cord. The CNS is protected by bone, but the PNS is not.The appearance of the human brain is not particularly impressive. It is covered in wrinkles, measures about 5-1/2 inches (140 millimeters) wide, 6-1/2 inches (167 millimeters) long, and 3-2/3 inches (93 millimeters) high, and weighs about 3 pounds (1.5 kilograms). The brain contains about 86 billion nerve cells, which make trillions of connections. The spinal cord contains about 1 billion nerve cells, reaches a length of 18 inches (45 millimeters) in men and 17 inches (43 millimeters) in women, and weighs about 1.2 ounces (35 grams). Its diameter ranges from about 0.4 inches (1 centimeter) to 0.6 inches (1.5 centimeters). The spinal cord is shorter than your spine. Your bony spinal column continues to grow between birth and adulthood, but the spinal cord itself does not. The brain and the spinal cord are among the best protected parts of your body, which is not surprising given their importance for your survival. Surrounding the brain and the spinal cord are the heavy bones of the skull and spinal vertebrae. Under these bones, membranes known as meninges provide further protection. Infections of these membranes result in potentially life-threatening cases of meningitis, for which you were possibly vaccinated before beginning your college studies. Meningitis is the inflammation of the membranes (meninges) covering the brain and the spinal cord. This condition can result from infection with bacteria, viruses, or fungi, with the bacterial infections being the most dangerous. Fortunately, most cases of bacterial meningitis can be prevented by vaccination. This image shows the distortion of the membranes caused by infection. The brain and the spinal cord are further protected by a clear, plasmalike fluid known as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF seeps out of the lining of hollow spaces in the brain known as the ventricles (see Figure 4.3). Near the base of the skull, openings enable CSF to flow from the ventricles into a space within the meninges, allowing the fluid to flow around the outer surfaces of the brain and spinal cord. CSF is constantly produced, so blockages in its circulation cause the fluid to build up. The result is hydrocephalus, which means water on the brain. The ventricles of the brain are filled with circulating cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which floats and cushions the brain. The cushioning provided by the CSF limits the damage produced by a blow to the head. As a result, single minor concussions are unlikely to produce long-term problems, but medical experts are becoming increasingly concerned about the effects of multiple concussions (Mannix, Meehan III, & Pascual-Leone, 2016). The CSF also floats the brain within the skull, preventing false signals that might result from the weight of some neurons pressing down on others. To diagnose some medical conditions, it is helpful to obtain a sample of CSF. This is done through a spinal tap, in which a physician removes some of the CSF circulating through the meninges surrounding the spinal cord. French neurologists were shocked when they saw brain images taken of a middle-age man who sought treatment for some minor weakness in one leg. His lateral ventricles (LV) take up most of the volume in his skull, and the brain appears as a thin layer on the outside. The patient reported that he had been treated for hydrocephalus from infancy until the age of 14. The patient was a married father of two who worked as a civil servant with a low but still normal IQ of 75.The spinal cord extends from the lowest part of the brain down into the middle of your back (see Figure 4.4). If you feel the back of your skull where it curves to meet your spine, your fingers will be just below the junction of the spinal cord and the lowest structure of the brain. Although the spinal cord is only 2% of the weight of the CNS, its functions are vital, as evidenced by the challenges faced by people with spinal damage. The spinal cord serves as a major conduit for information flowing to and from the brain along large bundles of nerve fibers, carrying sensory information from the body and delivering commands to muscles. A total of 31 pairs of spinal nerves exit the spinal cord between segments of the bony vertebrae in your spine to serve the body. Thirty-one pairs of spinal nerves exit between the bones of the vertebrae to bring sensory information back to the CNS and carry motor commands to muscles. Many important reflexes are initiated by the spinal cord without any assistance from the brain. One type of spinal reflex makes you pull your body away from a source of pain. It doesn’t take long for your hand to fly up when you’ve touched something hot on the stove. When tapping your knee with a hammer during a routine physical, your doctor is checking another type of spinal reflex, the knee-jerk reflex (see Figure 4.5). This reflex is interesting to your doctor because certain medical conditions, such as diabetes, affect the strength of the reflex. Still other spinal reflexes help us stand and walk. When your physician taps on your knee, your thigh muscle stretches. Information about the stretch is carried to the spinal cord by a sensory nerve. The spinal cord sends a command to the muscle to contract to counteract the stretch, and your foot kicks out. The spinal cord manages this reflex alone. No higher level of processing in the nervous system is necessary for this reflex to occur. Spinal reflexes give us an opportunity to look at the functions of three types of nerve cells, or neurons. Sensory neurons carry information from the external environment or from the body back to the CNS. In the knee-jerk reflex, sensory neurons tell the spinal cord that a muscle has been stretched by the tap of the hammer. Motor neurons carry commands from the CNS back to the muscles and glands of the body. In response to information about the stretched muscle, the spinal cord sends a message through motor neurons back to your leg, telling the muscle to contract to counteract the stretch. You know what happens next—your foot kicks as the muscles contract. Neurons that have neither sensory nor motor functions are called interneurons. Inter in this case means between, because many interneurons form bridges between sensory and motor neurons. The knee-jerk reflex forms a simple arc between a sensory neuron and a motor neuron and does not require interneurons. However, interneurons play important roles in other reflexes and throughout the nervous system. Moving up from the spinal cord brings us to the brainstem. Early in prenatal development, the emerging brain forms three bulges. The most forward of these bulges develops into the two large cerebral hemispheres, which we discuss in a later section. The remaining two bulges form the brainstembrainstemThe part of the brain containing the midbrain, pons, and medulla.            brainstem        The part of the brain containing the midbrain, pons, and medulla.            . If you examine Figure 4.6, you can see that the brainstem looks like the stem of a flower, supporting the larger blossom of the cerebral hemispheres. Directly branching from the brainstem are the cranial nerves, which perform the same functions for the head and neck areas that the spinal nerves manage for the remainder of the body. We will discuss the cranial nerves in more depth in a later section on the PNS. The brainstem contains structures responsible for reflexive behaviors, heart rate, breathing, arousal, sleep, preliminary sensory analysis, balance, and movement. The spinal cord merges with our first brainstem structure, the medullamedullaThe brainstem structure that lies just above the spinal cord.            medulla        The brainstem structure that lies just above the spinal cord.            . Like the spinal cord, the medulla contains large bundles of nerve fibers traveling to and from higher levels of the brain. The medulla manages many functions essential to life, such as heart rate, breathing, and blood pressure. Just above the medulla is the ponsponsA part of the brainstem located between the medulla and the midbrain.            pons        A part of the brainstem located between the medulla and the midbrain.            , which contains structures involved with the management of sleep, arousal, and facial expressions. Pons means bridge in Latin. The pons not only serves as a bridge between the higher and lower portions of the brain, but it also connects the cerebellumcerebellumA structure attached to the brainstem that participates in skilled movement and, in humans, complex cognitive processing            cerebellum        A structure attached to the brainstem that participates in skilled movement and, in humans, complex cognitive processing             to the rest of the brain. Essential for maintaining balance and motor coordination, the cerebellum is one of the first structures in the brain to be affected by alcohol. As a result, alcohol consumption impairs balance (walking a straight line) and motor coordination (touching your finger to the tip of your nose with your eyes closed). Most sobriety tests are the same tests a neurologist would use to assess the function of the cerebellum. Most sobriety tests assess the function of the cerebellum, which helps us maintain balance and muscle coordination. Opiate painkillers such as morphine and OxyContin produce some of their analgesic effects by interacting with opioid receptors in the periaqueductal gray. Surprisingly, the cerebellum contains more nerve cells than the rest of the brain combined. Not only does the cerebellum contain huge numbers of neurons, but it is also richly connected with the rest of the CNS. Because of the cerebellum’s position on the brainstem, which is relatively ancient in terms of evolution compared to the cerebral hemispheres, neuroscientists initially underestimated its importance to human behavior. They believed that the cerebellum’s activities were restricted to managing the timing and strength of movements. While we still do not know exactly what the cerebellum does, today’s neuroscientists believe that it has a broader role in making mental and motor skills more automatic. Damage to the human cerebellum produces subtle deficits in language, cognition, and perception. In autism spectrum disorder, a condition that affects language, sensory, and social behaviors, abnormalities in the cerebellum are common (Courchesne, 1997;  Fatemi et al., 2012). The midbrainmidbrainThe part of the brainstem that lies between the pons and the cerebral hemispheres            midbrain        The part of the brainstem that lies between the pons and the cerebral hemispheres             sits above the pons and contains a number of structures involved in sensory reflexes, movement, and pain. For example, the periaqueductal gray of the midbrain plays an important role in the body’s management of pain because it contains receptors for endorphins, our natural opioids, discussed later in this chapter and in Chapter 6. When endorphins are present in the periaqueductal gray, they reduce the perception of pain by decreasing the strength of pain messages traveling to higher levels of the brain. Nearby are other cell clusters that serve as the major sources of two important chemical messengers in the brain, serotonin and norepinephrine. These structures participate in states of arousal, mood, appetite, and aggression. Running the length of the brainstem’s core from the upper medulla into the midbrain is the reticular formationreticular formationA collection of structures located along the midline of the brainstem that participate in mood, arousal, and sleep.            reticular formation        A collection of structures located along the midline of the brainstem that participate in mood, arousal, and sleep.            , which participates in the management of levels of arousal, discussed further in Chapter 6. The cells in the reticular formation have two settings—fast and slow. When the cells are firing quickly, we usually show other signs of being awake. When the cells are firing slowly (or are damaged due to a stroke or other injury), an individual will enter either deep sleep or unconsciousness.Embedded within the vast tracts of nerve fibers or white matter that make up the bulk of the cerebral hemispheres are a number of subcortical structures that participate in self-awareness, learning, emotion, movement, communication, the inhibition of impulses, and the regulation of body states. We call them subcortical because they lie sub, which means below, the cerebral cortex, which comprises the wrinkled outermost covering of the cerebral hemispheres. Early anatomists collected some of these subcortical structures into a limbic system (limbic means border, and these structures form a gentle curve below the cerebral cortex), but this term is losing popularity with contemporary anatomists (Rolls, 2015). You might also have heard the limbic system called your emotional brain. As you will see in the next sections, some of these structures do participate in our emotional life, but they perform many other functions as well. We usually discuss subcortical structures in the singular, as in thalamus or hippocampus, but they actually are paired sets of structures, one on either side of the brain. Almost at the center of the brain lies the thalamusthalamusA subcortical structure involved with the processing of sensory information, states of arousal, and learning and memory            thalamus        A subcortical structure involved with the processing of sensory information, states of arousal, and learning and memory            . The thalamus is often called the gateway to the cortex, because input from most of our sensory systems (vision, hearing, touch, and taste) travels first to the thalamus, which then forwards the information to the cerebral cortex. The cortex, in turn, forms large numbers of connections with the thalamus. In addition to its role in sensation, the thalamus is involved with memory and states of consciousness. Lesions in the thalamus are associated with profound memory loss (Cipolotti et al., 2008). As you will learn in Chapter 6, during our deepest stages of sleep, the thalamus coordinates the activity of cortical neurons, tuning out the outside world, making it difficult to awaken. Disturbances in the circuits linking the thalamus and the cortex accompany some seizures. The basal gangliabasal gangliaA collection of subcortical structures that participate in the control of movement            basal ganglia        A collection of subcortical structures that participate in the control of movement             consist of several large structures involved with voluntary movement that curve around to cup the thalamus (see Figure 4.6 and Figure 4.7). The basal ganglia form complex circuits with motor structures located in the brainstem, the thalamus, and the cerebral cortex. Near the center of the brain, the thalamus receives input from most of our sensory systems and relays the information to the cerebral cortex. Curving around the thalamus are the basal ganglia, which form an important part of our voluntary movement systems. Degeneration of the basal ganglia occurs in Parkinson’s disease, a condition that makes the initiation of voluntary movement extremely difficult. The basal ganglia also contribute to several psychological disorders described in Chapter 14, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). These disorders are characterized by inadequate control of voluntary movement. In the case of OCD, patients may endlessly repeat a behavior, such as hand washing, while in ADHD, voluntary movements can be unusually frequent, rapid, and impulsive. The hypothalamushypothalamus4F A subcortical structure that participates in the regulation of thirst, temperature, hunger, sexual behavior, and aggression.            hypothalamus        4F A subcortical structure that participates in the regulation of thirst, temperature, hunger, sexual behavior, and aggression.             is involved with motivation and homeostasis (see Chapter 7), or the regulation of body functions such as temperature, thirst, hunger, biological rhythms, and sexual activities (see Figure 4.8). The hypothalamus is often described as contributing to the 4F behaviors: feeding, fleeing, fighting, and, well, sex (fornication). The hypothalamus carries out its motivational and homeostatic tasks by directing the autonomic nervous system and the endocrine system and its hormones, which we discuss in detail later in this chapter. Subcortical structures located under the cerebral cortex participate in attention, decision making, learning, memory, and emotion. The hippocampushippocampusA subcortical structure that participates in memory.            hippocampus        A subcortical structure that participates in memory.            , named for its shape after the Greek word for seahorse, is essential to the formation of long-term memories, which we discuss in more detail in Chapter 9. Memories are not stored permanently in the hippocampus, but it is likely that the hippocampus is involved in the storage and retrieval of memories located elsewhere in the brain. Damage to the hippocampus results in profound impairments in the ability to form new memories, but intelligence, personality, and most memories of events that occurred before hippocampal damage remain intact. The cingulate cortexcingulate cortexA subcortical structure above the corpus callosum. Its anterior (forward) segment participates in decision making and emotion, and its posterior (rear) segment participates in memory and visual processing.            cingulate cortex        A subcortical structure above the corpus callosum. Its anterior (forward) segment participates in decision making and emotion, and its posterior (rear) segment participates in memory and visual processing.             forms a fold of tissue on the inner surface of each cerebral hemisphere. The forward two thirds of this structure, known as the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), participate, along with the hypothalamus, in the control of the autonomic nervous system, which we discuss later in this chapter. The ACC also plays significant roles in decision making, emotion, anticipation of reward, and empathy. The rear third, or posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), participates in memory and visual processing. The amygdalaamygdalaA subcortical structure located in the temporal lobe believed to participate in emotional processing.            amygdala        A subcortical structure located in the temporal lobe believed to participate in emotional processing.             gets its name from the Greek word for almond because of its shape. One amygdala is deeply embedded in the temporal lobe, the wing of cortex that curves around the side of the brain, in each hemisphere. The amygdala receives sensory information (vision, hearing, and smell) and produces emotional and motivational output that is sent to the cerebral cortex. Although the amygdala responds to both positive and negative stimuli, it is best known for its role in identifying, remembering, and responding to fear and aggression. Research studies have found that the amygdala becomes more active when people are looking at pictures of fearful facial expressions. The more intense the expression of fear, the more activation is observed in the amygdala (Vuilleumier, Armony, Driver, & Dolan, 2001). Monkeys with damaged amygdalae approached unfamiliar monkeys boldly and fearlessly, which is uncharacteristic of these animals (Emery et al., 2001). They also failed to show their species’ typical fear of rubber snakes and unfamiliar humans (Mason, Capitanio, Machado, Mendoza, & Amaral, 2006). This image is taken from a man who is blind because of damage caused by a stroke to his visual areas, indicated by the red and green arrows. The orange area indicates activation of his amygdala when he is shown a photo of an angry face. This man couldn’t tell you whether he is looking at a tree, a building, or a face, let alone a happy or angry one, but his amygdala knows and reacts appropriately. Several behavioral deficits have been identified in a patient, known as Patient S. M., who experienced a rare medical condition that damaged her amygdalae in both hemispheres (Adolphs, Tranel, & Damasio, 1998) (see Figure 4.9). Although the patient can identify facial expressions of happiness, sadness, and disgust in photographs, she has a specific difficulty identifying expressions of fear. When researchers exposed Patient S. M. to snakes, spiders, and scary movies, she showed no signs of fear (Feinstein, Adolphs, Damasio, & Tranel, 2011). Although Patient S. M. shows no signs of antisocial behavior, other research indicates that people who harm others without feeling guilt are also impaired in their abilities to perceive fear in facial expressions or voices (Blair et al., 2002;  Marsh & Blair, 2008). The condition affecting Patient S. M. does not usually begin until after the age of 10, so having functional amygdalae in childhood might have helped Patient S. M. learn to act in prosocial ways. In addition to her difficulties in responding to fear stimuli, Patient S. M. shows other behavioral deficits related to her damaged amygdalae. Personal space, although variable across cultures, is consistent within cultures. Healthy control participants in the United States stand about 0.64 meter (about 2 feet) or arm’s length away from people they don’t know. In contrast, Patient S. M. prefers to stand nearly twice as close to others, or 0.34 meter (about 1 foot). Standing closer to strangers than is normal for your culture is likely to send inappropriate social messages of either threat or intimacy. The nucleus accumbensnucleus accumbensA subcortical structure that participates in reward and addiction.            nucleus accumbens        A subcortical structure that participates in reward and addiction.             is an important part of the brain’s reward and pleasure circuitry. Whether you are eating, having sex, using addictive drugs, gambling, or simply enjoying a beautiful sunset, this circuit comes into play (Comings & Blum, 2000). The circuit originates in cell bodies located in the midbrain that form connections with many subcortical structures and with the nucleus accumbens in particular. The activity of the nucleus accumbens is related to a person’s sense of social inclusion. When people who have strong connections to friends and family view a happy social scene, their nucleus accumbens becomes active. In contrast, when people with weaker social connections view the same happy scenes, their nucleus accumbens shows less activity than those of the socially connected people (Cacioppo, Norris, Decety, Monteleone, & Nusbaum, 2009).Above the brainstem, we find the two large cerebral hemispheres, which are connected by a large bundle of nerve fibers known as the corpus callosumcorpus callosumA wide band of nerve fibers connecting the right and left cerebral hemispheres.            corpus callosum        A wide band of nerve fibers connecting the right and left cerebral hemispheres.            . The thin layer of cells covering the outer surface of the cerebral hemispheres is the cerebral cortexcerebral cortexThe thin layer of neurons covering the outer surface of the cerebral hemispheres.            cerebral cortex        The thin layer of neurons covering the outer surface of the cerebral hemispheres.             (see Figure 4.10). The cortex, which means bark in Latin, covers the cerebral hemispheres like the bark of a tree. Most of the remaining bulk of the hemispheres is made up of white matter, or nerve fiber pathways, that connects the cortex with other parts of the nervous system. The average 20-year-old human brain has around 100,000 miles (162,500 kilometers) of white matter (Marner, Nyengaard, Tang, & Pakkenberg, 2003). The subcortical structures discussed earlier are distributed within this white matter. The cerebral cortex (cortex means bark) is a thin layer of cells on the outer surface of the brain. The closeup shows different views of the cortex, including the distribution of complete single cells, cell bodies, and myelin, the insulating material that covers most nerve fibers. If stretched out flat, the human cerebral cortex would cover an area of about 2.5 square feet (about 0.23 square meters). To fit within the confines of the skull, the cortex is convoluted or wrinkled. The degree of cortical convolution positively correlates with the general intellectual capacities of a species. For instance, human brains are more convoluted than sheep brains, which in turn are more convoluted than rat brains (see Figure 4.11). As species’ behavior becomes more complex, we see a corresponding increase in the degree of convolution (wrinkling) of the cerebral cortex. This wrinkling of the brain permits more brain tissue to fit within the skull. As a result, cortical size has increased more quickly over the course of evolution than skull size—an important adaptation given that large skulls are difficult to get through the birth canal. Each hemisphere of the cerebral cortex may be divided into four lobes, named after the bones of the skull that cover them (see Figure 4.12). Toward the front of the brain, we find the frontal lobefrontal lobeThe most forward of the four lobes of the cerebral cortex; location of the primary motor cortex and areas responsible for some of the most complex cognitive processes.            frontal lobe        The most forward of the four lobes of the cerebral cortex; location of the primary motor cortex and areas responsible for some of the most complex cognitive processes.            , and directly behind the frontal lobe lies the parietal lobeparietal lobeThe lobe of the cerebral cortex that lies at the top of the head between the frontal and the occipital lobes; location of the primary somatosensory cortex.            parietal lobe        The lobe of the cerebral cortex that lies at the top of the head between the frontal and the occipital lobes; location of the primary somatosensory cortex.            .

Curving around the side of each hemisphere, we find the temporal lobetemporal lobeThe lobe of the cerebral cortex that curves around the side of each hemisphere; location of the primary auditory cortex.            temporal lobe        The lobe of the cerebral cortex that curves around the side of each hemisphere; location of the primary auditory cortex.            . Because we have two hemispheres, it follows that we have pairs of each type of lobe, usually denoted right or left (e.g., right frontal lobe and left frontal lobe). The cerebral cortex is traditionally divided into four lobes: frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal. Diffusion tensor imaging highlights the rich arrays formed by the white matter in the brain. As we mentioned earlier in this chapter, the phrenologists were wrong in assuming that behavioral characteristics were reflected in bumps of the skull, but they were correct in suggesting that some functions were localized in particular parts of the brain. The functions performed by different areas of the cerebral cortex within the lobes fall into three categories: sensory, motor, and association. The sensory cortex processes incoming information from the sensory systems, such as vision or hearing, which we describe in Chapter 5. The primary visual cortex is in the occipital lobe, and the primary auditory cortex is in the temporal lobe. The primary somatosensory cortex (soma refers to body) is in the parietal lobe and processes information about touch, pain, body position, and skin temperature. The primary motor cortex is in the rearmost portion of the frontal lobe and provides the highest level of voluntary control over movement. Areas of the cortex that do not have specific sensory or motor functions are known as association cortex. Association means connection in this case, and association cortex helps us form bridges between sensation and action, language, and abstract thought. Association areas are distributed throughout the cortex. In addition to being the home of the primary motor cortex, the frontal lobe has a number of important, sophisticated cognitive functions. Adjacent to the primary motor cortex is Broca’s area, named after Paul Broca, who helped identify its functions in the 1860s. Broca’s area participates in the production of speech. Consequently, damage to Broca’s area caused by a stroke or a tumor produces considerable difficulty in speaking, although comprehension of speech remains good. The most forward portion of each frontal lobe, known as the prefrontal cortexprefrontal cortexThe most forward part of the frontal lobe of the cerebral cortex.            prefrontal cortex        The most forward part of the frontal lobe of the cerebral cortex.             (pre means before), is involved with the planning of behavior, attention, and judgment. Abnormalities of frontal lobe activity may account for characteristics of some psychological disorders, including schizophrenia and ADHD, which we will discuss in detail in Chapter 14. The role of the frontal lobes in the planning of behavior is illustrated by a bizarre condition known as alien hand syndrome, which occurs when connections between the prefrontal cortex and the lower areas of the brain involved in movement are damaged (Kikkert, Ribbers, & Koudstaal, 2006). This condition has no effect on sensory feedback from the limb, such as touch and position. However, patients with this condition do not seem to have control over their affected limbs and often remain unaware of the limbs’ activities until they are pointed out by another person. For instance, a hand might undo a button or remove clothing without the patient’s awareness of the activity. Patients do not recognize the rogue limb as their own and may use the other hand to wrestle with it in an attempt to control it forcibly or punish it for its activities. The importance of the frontal lobes is also illustrated by the results of a terrible accident that befell a young railroad worker named Phineas Gage in 1848. While Gage was preparing to blast through some granite, a freak accident sent an iron tamping rod through his head before it landed about 30 feet (about 9 meters) away. The rod entered his head under his left cheekbone, passed behind his left eye, and exited out the middle of his forehead. Remarkably, Gage survived, but he was not the same person as before his accident. Although outwardly normal in his intelligence, speech, and movement, Gage became prone to angry outbursts and unreliability, which made it difficult for him to find and keep employment. As his doctor noted, His contractors, who regarded him as the most efficient and capable foreman in their employ previous to his injury, considered the change in his mind so marked that they could not give him his place again (Fleischman, 2002, p. 20). Early scientists discovered that nerves carry only one type of information. When you take a blow to the back of the head, where your primary visual cortex is found, your occipital lobe does not know how to say, ouch. Instead, it responds to the blow as if you saw a flash of light (not necessarily the tweeting birds or stars indicated in cartoons). Gage suffered his accident when modern imaging technologies were nowhere to be seen on the scientific horizon. Today, we know more about why Gage behaved the way he did because of his accident. Scientists initially recreated the pathway that Gage’s tamping rod must have traveled (Damasio, Grabowski, Frank, Galaburda, & Damasio, 1994). More recent analyses show that the rod did more damage to the fiber pathways in Gage’s brain than to the cells of his cerebral cortex (Van Horn et al., 2012). The rod disrupted 11% of the connections in Gage’s brain, compared to 4% of the cells in his cortex. The rod missed areas involved in speech, voluntary movement, and the senses of touch, body position, and pain. Thus, Gage had no difficulty speaking or performing complex movements, such as driving a stagecoach, following his accident. Modern patients with damage in this area exhibit many of the same social deficits that Gage demonstrated (Damasio & Anderson, 1993;  Damasio, Tranel, & Damasio, 1991;  Eslinger & Damasio, 1985). They are impulsive, emotionally unstable, unpredictable, and unable to make reasonable decisions. Phineas Gage suffered a terrible injury to his frontal lobes. Modern imaging techniques allowed scientists to recreate the pathway of Gage’s tamping iron through his brain. Remarkably, Gage survived, although his friends described him as a changed man. Knowing the outcome of the Gage case, you might be astonished to learn that physicians in the 1940s and 1950s deliberately damaged the frontal lobes of nearly 50,000 American patients in a procedure known as a frontal lobotomy. The intent of the procedure was to reduce fear and anxiety in patients with serious psychological disorders, which it accomplished in many cases but at great expense to the patient. As you might suspect from reading about Gage, many patients who underwent the procedure were unable to work or live normal lives because of their impulsive, antisocial behavior. The orbitofrontal cortexorbitofrontal cortexA part of the prefrontal cortex located right behind the eyes that participates in impulse control.            orbitofrontal cortex        A part of the prefrontal cortex located right behind the eyes that participates in impulse control.            , a part of the prefrontal cortex located just behind the bony orbits protecting the eyes, plays an important role in our emotional lives (see Figure 4.13). People with damage to the orbitofrontal cortex demonstrate dramatic deficits in their social behavior and experience of emotion, despite retaining their intelligence, language skills, and abilities to pay attention, learn, and remember (Bechara, Damasio, & Damasio, 2000;  Damasio, 1994;  Damasio & Anderson, 1993). People with damage to their orbitofrontal cortex have difficulty controlling impulses and anticipating the negative outcomes of poor decisions. This part of the brain is one of the last areas to mature. Patient E. V. R. experienced orbitofrontal damage during surgery for a tumor (Eslinger & Damasio, 1985). Before his surgery, E. V. R. was considered a role model and a respected member of his community. Following his surgery, E. V. R. lost his job, went bankrupt, and divorced his wife to marry a prostitute, whom he divorced 2 years later. Although he had no difficulties talking about moral dilemmas, he experienced enormous problems when trying to make everyday decisions, such as buying toothpaste or choosing a restaurant. Researchers have made other connections between abnormalities in the orbitofrontal cortex and antisocial behavior. In a sample of 21 individuals diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder, a condition characterized by disregard for others that we discuss in Chapter 14, the volume of the prefrontal cortex, which includes the orbitofrontal cortex, was about 11% less than in control participants who did not have the condition (Raine, Lencz, Bihrle, LaCasse, & Colletti, 2000). Individuals with antisocial personality disorder or orbitofrontal damage not only fail to anticipate the emotional consequences of situations but also are unable to delay gratification. They typically choose immediate rewards over long-term benefits, such as stealing something now despite knowing the long-term benefits of staying out of jail. The occipital lobe, located at the back of the brain, is home to the primary visual cortex. The primary visual cortex begins the process of interpreting input from the eyes by responding to basic information about an image, such as its borders, shading, color, and movement. This amount of processing by itself does not allow you to read this page or recognize your professor in the library. Two important pathways link the occipital lobe with the rest of the brain. A pathway connecting the occipital lobe with the temporal lobe allows you to recognize objects you see. A second pathway connects the occipital lobe with the parietal lobe and allows you to process the movement of objects. We discuss these processes further in the next sections. The temporal lobe has several areas that are specialized for particular functions. The temporal lobe is home to the primary auditory cortex, which allows us to process incoming sounds. As mentioned earlier, the temporal lobe processes some higher visual system tasks, including the recognition of objects and the faces of familiar people. Patients with damage to the temporal lobe are often unable to recognize their loved ones by sight. They must wait until the person speaks. We discuss this processing of vision and hearing by the temporal lobe in more detail in Chapter 5. We saw earlier how damage to Broca’s area in the frontal lobe produced difficulty in speaking. Damage to another language area located in the temporal lobe, Wernicke’s area, produces different results (see Figure 4.12). As we discuss in Chapter 10, patients with damage to their Wernicke’s area speak fluently but make no sense. They cannot comprehend speech, but they seem blissfully unaware of their deficits. The parietal lobe is home to the primary somatosensory cortex, which helps us localize touch, pain, skin temperature, and body position. Damage to the parietal lobe can produce the odd symptoms of neglect syndrome. Patients with this condition have difficulty perceiving part of their body or part of the visual field (see Figure 4.14). Patients with certain types of brain damage in the parietal lobe experience hemispatial neglect, or the inability to pay attention to stimuli located in space on the opposite side relative to their damage. They seem unaware that there is anything wrong with their perceptions. The patient whose drawings are featured in this figure experienced damage to the right hemisphere, resulting in neglect for anything to the left in space. Neglect does not affect vision alone but can also affect the sense of body location. One patient was unable to recognize his own leg and suspected the hospital staff of putting a cadaver leg into his bed. The parietal lobe processes input about taste and, like the temporal lobe, it engages in some complex processing of vision. Whereas the temporal lobe participates in visual recognition, the parietal lobe tells us how quickly something is moving toward us. This can be an essential bit of information when deciding whether it is safe to make a left turn in front of oncoming traffic. We discuss these functions of the parietal lobe in depth in Chapter 5. In the early 1990s, Giacomo Rizzolatti and a team of Italian scientists were busy studying the brain correlates of movement when they noticed something odd (Di Pellegrino, Fadiga, Fogassi, Gallese, & Rizzolatti, 1992). They had observed that certain neurons in a part of a monkey’s brain became especially active when the monkey performed certain actions, like reaching for a piece of banana or a peanut. When an experimenter picked up a piece of food to place it within the monkey’s reach, some of the same neurons began to fire. Suspecting something important was behind these observations, the researchers began to study these mirror neurons more carefully. The scientists believed that mirror neurons provided a mechanism for understanding the actions of others (Caggiano et al., 2011). Psychology, and biological psychology in particular, have a great deal to say to the criminal justice system regarding a person’s capacity for responsible behavior. In 1843, Daniel M’Naghten planned to assassinate British prime minister Sir Robert Peel but shot his secretary, Edward Drummond, instead. M’Naghten was acquitted by reason of insanity and spent the remainder of his life in hospitals for the insane rather than prison. M’Naghten’s legacy in English and U. S. law is the insanity defense, which means that a mental condition that prevents understanding of the act and/or the wrongfulness of the act removes responsibility for the act (Mobbs, Lau, Jones, & Frith, 2007). The U. S. criminal justice system continues to struggle with issues of maturity, mental illness, and responsibility for one’s actions. In 2005, 13-year-old Roberto Holguin murdered 87-year-old Army veteran Gerald O’Malley by hitting him in the head with a skateboard. In 2014, while still incarcerated, Holguin sent California Governor Jerry Brown an email that said, I will shoot you with a real gun. Brown subsequently overturned a parole board decision for early release for Holguin, but by law, Holguin could not be held longer than his 25th birthday in 2017. These issues came close to the home of one of the authors. In 2005, a local 13-year-old boy used a skateboard to bludgeon 87-year-old Gerald O’Malley to death. The boy told police, I knew it was wrong; I just did it. Joseph Wu, director of the Brain Imaging Center at the University of California, Irvine, told the court that the young murderer had abnormally reduced activity in parts of his brain that govern a person’s judgment (Sneed, 2006, p. B1). Does the insanity defense apply when there is evidence of abnormalities in parts of the brain that govern a person’s judgment? Further understanding of the brain’s structure and function in both law-abiding people and criminals will contribute to the legal system’s ability to handle such cases fairly. If you’re curious about the young murderer’s outcome, the court rejected suggestions that he needed treatment instead of incarceration. He was sentenced to a state juvenile corrections facility, from which he was automatically freed at age 25 (Fountain, 2016). Athletic success often depends upon the athlete’s ability to predict an opponent’s intentions quickly enough to react appropriately. In tennis, the reading of an opponent’s serve is especially important, as the time required to plan and implement a response is longer than the flight time of the ball (Cacioppo et al., 2014). The Question: How do expert tennis players predict their opponents’ serve quickly enough to respond well?Twenty-five male tennis players were observed using fMRI as they viewed films of players serving the ball in one of two conditions: the player serving the ball knew where he wanted to place the serve (initially intended) orthe player was told by an experimenter where he should place the serve after he had already tossed the ball (noninitially intended). The players viewing the films were asked to indicate where they thought the ball would go. Because fMRI is a safe procedure, this study raises few ethical concerns. Nonetheless, the participants must freely volunteer and provide informed consent. Their confidentiality should be strictly protected. The more expert the tennis player being scanned, the more successful he was at predicting where the serve would land, but only when the server in the film knew where the ball was supposed to go before he tossed the ball in the air. When the server didn’t know until the last minute where the ball was supposed to go, all viewers performed no better than chance. Accurate predictions of the location of the serve were correlated with activation of mirror neuron systems and subcortical structures involved with motor memory. The scientists demonstrated that reading the intentions of others is a remarkably complex process involving the mirror neuron system. This system is more likely to be activated when we observe a person whose actions are relevant to our goals, such as our opponent in a tennis match, than if a person’s actions are irrelevant, such as an usher in the grandstand. Correctly reading your opponent’s intentions, but not the usher’s, is critical to your success. Do human beings, as well as monkeys, possess mirror neurons? Research on humans typically involves brain imaging, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), so we see the activity of larger areas of the brain (mirror systems) rather than single neurons. It does appear, though, that human beings possess mirror systems that help us understand not just the actions and emotions of others, but their intentions as well (Iacoboni et al., 2005). Initially, researchers looked for mirror systems in the vicinity of the motor cortex in the frontal lobe, but other areas of the brain seem to have similar mirror capacities, allowing us to relate to feelings of disgust and of being touched expressed by others (Keysers et al., 2004;  Wicker et al., 2003). A special type of localization of function in the cerebral cortex is known as lateralization, or the localization of a function in either the right or the left cerebral hemisphere. A basic type of lateralization occurs in the somatosensory and voluntary motor systems in the brain. Movement and sensation on the right side of the body are processed by the left hemisphere, and movement and sensation on the left side of the body by the right hemisphere. If you observe a person who is paralyzed on the right side of the body, you can be fairly certain that this paralysis is a result of motor cortex damage in the left hemisphere. In a similar manner, the visual cortex of the left hemisphere processes all data from the right half of the visual field, while the right hemisphere processes all data from the left half of the visual field. In other words, when you look straight ahead, holding your eyes and head still, everything to the right or left of center is processed by the opposite hemisphere. Much of our knowledge of lateralization of the human brain resulted from the careful analysis of a surgical procedure known as a split-brain operation (see Figure 4.15). To treat rare cases of life-threatening seizures, surgeons in the 1960s cut the patients’ corpus callosum and other pathways connecting the right and left cerebral hemispheres (Bogen, Schultz, & Vogel, 1988). The procedure not only succeeded in reducing or eliminating seizures, but it also produced no changes in personality, intelligence, or speech. Only when patients were studied in the laboratory were the consequences of their surgery evident. A typical experiment demonstrating the differences in processing by the right and left hemispheres (Gazzaniga, 1967) is illustrated in Figure 4.16. To save patients from life-threatening seizures, physicians cut the corpus callosum, a large band of nerve fibers connecting the right and left hemispheres. If participants fixate on a dot in the middle of the screen, information to the left of the dot is processed by the right hemisphere, and information to the right of the dot is processed by the left hemisphere. When asked verbally what word was seen, participants answered art, which was seen by the verbal left hemisphere. When asked to point with the left hand, which is controlled by the right hemisphere, to the word that was seen, the participants pointed to he, which is the word seen by the right hemisphere. Subsequent research indicated that language, for most people, is lateralized to the left hemisphere, although a minority of individuals process language either in the right hemisphere or in both hemispheres (Rasmussen & Milner, 1977). The lateralization of language is correlated, although not completely, with a person’s handedness. As shown in a later section, nearly all right-handed people lateralize language to the left hemisphere, as do about 70% of people who are left-handed. The remaining individuals process language either in the right hemisphere or in both hemispheres. For most people, activity in the left hemisphere is correlated with positive emotions while activity in the right hemisphere is correlated with more negative emotions. Language is not the only cognitive process to show evidence of lateralization. Other suspected lateralized processes include mathematical computation and logical reasoning (left hemisphere) and some music functions, spatial information, intuition, and the visual arts (right hemisphere). Emotional behavior also appears to be lateralized. In most people, activity of the left hemisphere is correlated with positive emotions, whereas activity in the right hemisphere is correlated with negative emotions, providing the cortex with a rough distinction between approaching positive things (left hemisphere activity) and avoiding negative things (right hemisphere activity) (Davidson & Irwin, 1999). Anesthetizing the left hemisphere results in temporary feelings of depression, while anesthetizing the right hemisphere produces happiness (Lee et al., 2004). A word of caution is in order here. As noted by Roger Sperry, who won the 1981 Nobel Prize for his investigations of lateralization in the human brain, The left–right dichotomy in cognitive mode is an idea with which it is very easy to run wild (Sperry, 1982, p. 1225). Most of us have not undergone a split-brain procedure. Our intact corpus callosum and other connections between the two cerebral hemispheres allow information to pass rapidly from one hemisphere to the other. Suggestions that you can improve your artistic or athletic talent or reduce inattention by learning to access your right brain have gained considerable attention in the popular press, but they do not hold up to scrutiny in the laboratory. One of the most popular myths about lateralization is the idea that individual differences in artistic talent or logical thinking correlate with a person’s dominant hemisphere. Hemisphere dominance, as measured by the relative size of the hemispheres and the localization of language and handedness, does not predict occupational choice or artistic talent (Springer & Deutsch, 1998). Humans are not the only animals to have a preferred hand. However, other primates, such as this chimpanzee using a stone to open nuts, are equally likely to be right- or left-handed. In contrast, more than 90% of humans are right-handed. What are the advantages of lateralization? Most species of animals show a preference for one hand or the other, such as when a cat reaches for its prey (Cole, 1955;  Holder, 1999). Lateralization might provide organisms with the ability to multitask (Rogers, 2000). Chicks raised in the dark fail to lateralize visually guided responses normally and are at a disadvantage compared to normal chicks when feeding and watching for predators simultaneously. Success in this type of multitasking has obvious survival advantages. Human lateralization of brain structures might have made language possible (Berlim, Mattevi, Belmonte-de-Abreu, & Crow, 2003). This development could have a big price tag, however, because lateralization might account for our species’ vulnerabilities for schizophrenia, as discussed in Chapter 14. People with schizophrenia show abnormal hemisphere lateralization and are more likely to be left-handed or to have ambiguous handedness (Berlim et al., 2003). As shown in Table 4.2, lateralization of language is correlated with handedness (Milner, 1974). Handedness represents a continuum, with some people being nearly ambidextrous and others having strong preferences for using one hand or the other. Although most of us would have no trouble answering a question asking whether we are right- or left-handed, researchers like Milner must apply systems for determining a person’s handedness. One of the frequently used instruments follows. HandednessLanguage leftLanguage rightMixed dominanceRight-handed (90%)96%4%0%Left-handed (10%)70%15%15%Simply read each of the questions in Table 4.3. Decide which hand you use for each activity, and then circle the answer that describes you the best. If you are unsure of any answer, try to act out the action. To find your score, count the number of circled right answers and subtract the number of circled left answers. Ignore either answers. Ambidextrous people will score around 0, very right-handed people will score near +12, and very left-handed people will score near −12.1. With which hand do you draw?LeftRightEither2. Which hand would you use to throw a ball to hit a target?LeftRightEither3. In which hand would you use an eraser on paper?LeftRightEither4.

In which hand would you use a fly swatter?Although this test can’t tell you which hemisphere you use for language, your odds of using your left hemisphere for language if you’re very right-handed are quite high. Although efforts to connect brain lateralization, which is highly correlated with handedness, with occupational choice or artistic talent have not been successful, being in the left-handed minority might provide advantages in sports and in combat. Right-handed pitchers, such as Tim Lincecum, are often challenged by left-handed hitters such as Adrian Gonzalez.

The lights may be on, but not much is going to happen. In this section, we will explore the structures of the PNS that provide these essential input and output functions in the body. The PNS can be separated into two divisions: the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system. The somatic nervous system includes the peripheral portions of the sensory and voluntary movement systems. The autonomic nervous system is responsible for the actions of many glands and organs. Additional output is provided by the endocrine system, through which the CNS can communicate with the body by releasing chemical messengers into the bloodstream. These systems coordinate their efforts to produce consistent patterns of movement, hormone release, and arousal.The somatic nervous systemsomatic nervous systemThe part of the peripheral nervous system that brings sensory information to the central nervous system and transmits commands to the muscles.            somatic nervous system        The part of the peripheral nervous system that brings sensory information to the central nervous system and transmits commands to the muscles.             is the part of the PNS that transmits commands for voluntary movement from the CNS to the muscles and brings sensory input back to the CNS for further processing. These functions are carried out by the 31 pairs of spinal nerves serving the torso and limbs and the 12 pairs of cranial nerves serving the head, neck, and some internal organs (see Figure 4.17). Twelve pairs of cranial nerves carry sensory and motor information from the brain to the head, the neck, and some internal organs.The function of the autonomic nervous systemautonomic nervous systemThe division of the peripheral nervous system that directs the activity of glands, organs, and smooth muscles.            autonomic nervous system        The division of the peripheral nervous system that directs the activity of glands, organs, and smooth muscles.             is the control of tissues other than the skeletal muscle (Langley, 1921)—in other words, our glands and organs. The term autonomic has the same root as the word autonomy, or independence. You might think of this system as the cruise control of the body because it ensures that your heart keeps beating and your lungs continue to inhale and exhale without your conscious direction. The autonomic nervous system contains three subdivisions: the sympathetic, the parasympathetic, and the enteric. Biofeedback training helps people gain conscious control over some autonomic processes that normally run in the background. People who suffer from migraine headaches can be trained to reduce blood flow to the brain. The sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions are active under different circumstances. The sympathetic nervous systemsympathetic nervous systemThe division of the autonomic nervous system that coordinates arousal            sympathetic nervous system        The division of the autonomic nervous system that coordinates arousal             prepares the body for situations requiring the expenditure of energy, while the parasympathetic nervous systemparasympathetic nervous systemThe part of the autonomic nervous system associated with rest, repair, and energy storage.            parasympathetic nervous system        The part of the autonomic nervous system associated with rest, repair, and energy storage.             directs the storage of energy. You have probably experienced intense sympathetic arousal, perhaps because of a close call on the highway. In the aroused state produced by the sympathetic nervous system, our hearts race, we breathe rapidly, our faces become pale, and our palms sweat. All these activities are designed to provide the muscles with the resources they need for a fight-or-flight reaction. The sympathetic nervous system is important to our understanding of stress, described further in Chapter 16. In contrast, the parasympathetic nervous system controls the glands and organs at times of relative calm. Instead of using up energy like the sympathetic nervous system does, the parasympathetic nervous system allows you to store nutrients, repair your body, and return the activities of internal organs to baseline levels. Stress activates the sympathetic nervous system, preparing the body for fight or flight or, in this case, fast paddling. The responses of the internal organs to environmental stimuli reflect a sophisticated combination of inputs from both the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous systems (Berntson, Cacioppo, & Quigley, 1991). These systems usually have antagonistic effects on the organs they serve and are designed to alternate their activities (see Figure 4.18). We cannot be simultaneously relaxed and aroused. The sympathetic nervous system dilates the pupils of the eye, whereas the parasympathetic nervous system constricts the pupils. The heart responds to sympathetic commands by beating faster but responds to parasympathetic commands by slowing down. The two divisions do manage, however, to cooperate during sexual activity. The sympathetic nervous system (left) usually has the opposite effect on an organ compared with the parasympathetic nervous system (right). For example, sympathetic input tells the heart to beat faster, while parasympathetic input tells the heart to slow down. However, both systems cooperate during sex. The enteric nervous systementeric nervous systemA division of the autonomic nervous system consisting of nerve cells embedded in the lining of the gastrointestinal system            enteric nervous system        A division of the autonomic nervous system consisting of nerve cells embedded in the lining of the gastrointestinal system            , shown in Figure 4.19, consists of nerve cells embedded in the lining of the gastrointestinal system. This system is often called a second brain because it contains as many nerve cells as are found in the spinal cord. The enteric nervous system communicates with the endocrine system, described later in this chapter, to ensure the release of chemicals essential to digestion. Some functions of the enteric nervous system result in conscious perceptions, such as gastrointestinal pain, hunger, and satiety (fullness), while others operate below the threshold of conscious awareness. The latter give rise to our references to having a gut feeling. Disturbances of the enteric environment might contribute to the development of autism spectrum disorder (Slattery, MacFabe, Kahler, & Frye, 2016). The enteric nervous system is the source of 95% of the body’s serotonin, a neurochemical discussed later in this chapter. Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (see Chapter 14) show higher than normal levels of serotonin in their blood (Janusonis, 2008) and often experience gastric distress (Kazek et al., 2013). The enteric nervous system is often called a second brain. It has about the same number of neurons as the spinal cord, or about as many found in the entire brain of an adult cat.The nervous system communicates by passing messages along nerves. In contrast, the endocrine systemendocrine systemA system responsible for the release of hormones into the bloodstream.            endocrine system        A system responsible for the release of hormones into the bloodstream.             is made up of glands that release chemical messengers known as hormones into the blood (see Figure 4.20). These chemicals are often identical to those used by one nerve cell to communicate with another, but their actions affect more distant cells in a coordinated fashion. Ultimately, the endocrine system responds to input from the nervous system and from the hypothalamus in particular. The endocrine system is especially involved with arousal, metabolism, growth, and sex. Among the important glands of the endocrine system are the pineal gland, the pituitary gland, the thyroid gland, the adrenal glands, the islets of Langerhans, and the ovaries in females and testes in males. Human growth hormone, released normally by the pituitary gland, has become a popular substance among actors and athletes. Sylvester Stallone (1946- ), star of Rocky and Rambo, is one of the few Hollywood stars to discuss his use of the hormone publicly. The endocrine system communicates with other body tissues by releasing hormones from glands into the bloodstream. The pineal gland, and its release of the chemical messenger melatonin, is important in the maintenance of our sleep–wake cycles, which we discuss in Chapter 6. Although not an officially approved and tested medication, melatonin is used by some travelers to offset the unpleasant effects of jet lag. Melatonin is normally released in the early evening, and it breaks down in the presence of light. Thus, exposure to artificial light at night can have negative implications for our health. For example, higher rates of cancer among people working night shifts in hospitals have been attributed to the breakdown of melatonin by light (Dopfel, Schulmeister, & Schernhammer, 2007). The pituitary gland, located just above the roof of your mouth, is often called the body’s master gland, because many of the hormones it releases activate other glands. The pituitary in turn is regulated by the hypothalamus, which lies directly above it. The pituitary hormones form two groups. One group, including oxytocin, vasopressin, and human growth hormone, is released directly from the pituitary. The second group consists of hormones that influence the release of hormones by other glands. Oxytocin and vasopressin participate in several important physical functions, such as breastfeeding and maintenance of fluid levels, respectively. However, these hormones are also implicated in cooperation and trust, memory for social information, recognition of emotions, and resilience during stress (Meyer-Lindenberg, Domes, Kirsch, & Heinrichs, 2011). Growth hormone stimulates growth and regeneration, making it a popular performance-enhancing substance used illegally by some elite athletes. Oxytocin released by the pituitary gland is correlated with human bonding between parent and child and between romantic partners. Other pituitary hormones control the production and release of sex hormones by the ovaries and the testes, initiating puberty and maintaining fertility. In response to pituitary hormones, the thyroid gland—located just below your larynx, or voice box, in your throat—raises or lowers your rate of metabolism, or the chemical processes your body needs to sustain life. Low levels of thyroid can mimic the symptoms of depression, described further in Chapter 14. At times of stress, pituitary hormones activate the adrenal glands, which are located just above the kidneys in the lower back. In response, the adrenal glands release other hormones, including cortisol, that travel throughout the body and the brain to provide a general wake-up message. The islets of Langerhans, located in the pancreas, produce hormones essential to digestion, including insulin. StructureWhat to rememberSomatic nervous systemSensation and movement12 pairs of cranial nerves31 pairs of spinal nervesAutonomic nervous systemSympathetic nervous system: arousal and fight or flightParasympathetic nervous system: rest and repairEnteric nervous system: control of the gastrointestinal systemEndocrine systemMetabolism, arousal, growth, sexGlandsHormonesWe now zoom in to explore the microscopic building blocks of the nervous system, which are the nerve cells, or neuronsneuronsA cell of the nervous system that is specialized to send and receive neural messages.            neurons        A cell of the nervous system that is specialized to send and receive neural messages.            . Human brains have about 100 billion neurons. To put this number into perspective, consider the following: If each neuron represented a second, ticking off the neurons in your body alone would take more than 3,170 years. With each neuron forming an average of several thousand connections with other neurons, the connections in the human brain number in the hundreds of trillions. In addition to these large numbers of neurons, the nervous system contains many supporting cells, known as glia. Although it sounds like a script from a science fiction film, researchers are capable of growing neurons, such as these from the retina of the eye, on silicon chips. The chip electrically stimulates the growing neurons. Future uses of this type of technology might include brainlike computer networks and better prostheses for people who have lost a limb. Once you are familiar with the structure of neurons and glia, we will explore the ways neurons communicate with one another. Neural communication is a two-step process. The first step takes place within a single neuron and involves the generation of an electrical signal. The second step takes place between two neurons and involves the release of a chemical messenger from one neuron that affects the activity of the second.Neurons share many characteristics with other cells found in the body. Like other cells, a neuron has a large central mass or cell bodycell bodyThe large, central mass of a neuron, containing the nucleus.            cell body        The large, central mass of a neuron, containing the nucleus.            , and within the cell body, it has a nucleus (see Figure 4.21). Most housekeeping tasks of the cell, such as the translation of genetic codes into the manufacture of proteins, take place in the cell body. Like other cells, neurons feature an outer membrane, which surrounds the neuron and forms a barrier between the fluid outside the cell (the extracellular fluid) and the fluid inside the cell (the intracellular fluid). The neural membrane is composed of fatty materials that do not dissolve in water, so even though it is only two molecules thick, it is able to hold apart the water-based fluids on either side. Pores within the membrane act as channels that allow chemicals to move into or out of the cell. Neurons share many features with other living cells but are specialized for the processing of information. (a) Parts of the neuron. Like other types of animal cells, the neuron features a nucleus in its cell body and a fatty membrane that separates intracellular and extracellular fluids. Unlike most other cells, the neuron has specialized branches, the axon and the dendrites, that pass information to and receive information from other cells. (b) A closeup view of the axon membrane. A thin, oily membrane separates the intracellular fluid inside the neuron from the extracellular fluid outside the neuron. Pores spanning the membrane act as channels that allow ions to move into and out of the neuron. (c) A closeup view of the axon terminal. Within the axon terminal are synaptic vesicles, which contain chemical messengers called neurotransmitters that transmit signals between neurons. Later in the chapter, we’ll see how these neurotransmitters communicate with receptors on the dendrites of other neurons. Unlike other types of body cells, neurons have two types of branches that extend from the cell body to allow the neuron to perform its information-processing and communication functions. The branches known as axonsaxonsThe branch of a neuron that is usually responsible for transmitting information to other neurons.            axons        The branch of a neuron that is usually responsible for transmitting information to other neurons.             are responsible for carrying information to other neurons, while the branches known as dendritesdendritesA branch from the neural cell body that usually receives input from other neurons.            dendrites        A branch from the neural cell body that usually receives input from other neurons.             receive input from other neurons. Although neurons may have many dendrites, each neuron typically has only one axon. Many axons communicate with immediately adjacent cells and are, therefore, only small fractions of a millimeter in length, but other axons are much longer. When you stub your big toe on a rock, the neurons that process this information have cell bodies in your lower back and axons that extend all the way down to your sore toe, a distance of around 3 feet (about 0.9 meters), depending on your height. At its farthest point from the cell body, an axon bulges to form a terminal. If you look inside an axon terminal with an electron microscope, you can see round, hollow spheres known as synaptic vesicles, which contain molecules of chemical messengers. We have been using the term white matter to describe pathways formed by nerve fibers or axons. You have probably heard the term gray matter as well. Now that you understand the structure of neurons, these terms will make more sense. When we prepare neural tissue for study using microscopes, the chemicals used to preserve the tissue are absorbed by cell bodies. This gives cell bodies a pink–gray coloring. In contrast, these chemicals are repelled by the insulating material covering most axons because the insulation has a fatty composition that doesn’t mix well with the watery preservatives (we discuss the nature of this insulation shortly). As a result, axons look white, like the fat in a steak. When we examine images of the brain, areas that look gray have a high density of cell bodies, whereas areas that look white consist of large bundles of axons. The blood–brain barrier might offer too much protection to the brain in some cases. Many chemotherapy agents used to treat cancer in other parts of the body cannot penetrate the blood–brain barrier, which complicates the treatment of tumors in the brain. If neurons are the stars of the nervous system team, gliagliaNervous system cells that perform a variety of support functions, including formation of the blood-brain barrier and myelin.            glia        Nervous system cells that perform a variety of support functions, including formation of the blood-brain barrier and myelin.             are the trainers, coaches, and scorekeepers. They make it possible for neurons to do their job effectively. Some glia (from the Greek word for glue) provide a structural matrix for neurons, ensuring that the neurons stay in place (see Figure 4.22). Other glia are mobile, allowing them to move to a location where neurons have been damaged to clean up debris. Glia form tight connections with the blood vessels serving the nervous system. This forms a blood–brain barrier that prevents many toxins circulating in the blood from exiting into brain tissue where neurons could be harmed. Psychoactive drugs, by definition, are substances capable of penetrating the blood–brain barrier with ease. We discuss psychoactive drugs and the ways in which they act on the nervous system in Chapter 6. Glia form tight connections with the blood vessels in the nervous system, preventing many toxins from entering the brain. Glia also help hold neurons in place and form the myelin on some axons. In vertebrates such as humans, glia wrap around some axons like sausages on strings at a delicatessen, forming an important layer of insulation called myelinmyelinThe insulating material covering some axons.            myelin        The insulating material covering some axons.            . Myelin makes neural signaling fast and energy efficient. We will discuss how myelin accomplishes this in a later section on neural signaling. By speeding up the transmission of neural signals and contributing to quicker recovery between signals, myelin increases the amount of information a neuron can transmit per second by a factor of 3,000 times (Giedd et al., 2015). Not all axons in the human nervous system are myelinated. When you hurt yourself, the fast, sharp ouch message is carried to the brain by myelinated axons, but the dull, achy message that lasts a lot longer is carried by unmyelinated axons. One type of glia forms the myelin in the brain and the spinal cord, and a second type forms the myelin in the remainder of the nervous system (see Figure 4.23). These two types of glia behave quite differently from each other when they are damaged. Glia in the brain and the spinal cord form scar tissue, inhibiting repair to the damaged nerves. Because of this feature, we consider damage in the CNS to be permanent. Considerable research is under way to figure out how to repair such damage, including work using stem cells to grow bridges across the damaged areas. In contrast, damaged glia in the PNS do not form scar tissue and instead help the damaged axons regrow. As a result, nerve damage in these areas can heal. If this were not so, operations to reattach limbs would be doomed to failure. Today, not only are digits and even limbs that were lost in accidents routinely reattached to their rightful owners, but a number of patients whose own hands or faces were damaged beyond repair have undergone successful transplants from cadavers (Clarke & Butler, 2009;  Dubernard, Owen, Lanzetta, & Hakim, 2001). One type of glia forms myelin in the CNS, and a second type forms myelin in the PNS. These types of glia respond differently to nerve damage, making nerve damage outside the brain and spinal cord easier to repair. While on duty as a volunteer fireman in 2001, Patrick Hardison experienced catastrophic burn damage to his face. His original appearance before the accident is shown on the left. In 2015, a team of over 100 medical professionals transplanted a donor face onto Hardison. His current appearance is shown on the right. This type of operation would be useless unless the nerves in the face were able to establish new connections. Hardison expressed joy in an interview about his ability to feel his children’s touch on his face again. As we explore further in Chapter 11, myelin growth in the human nervous system begins before birth, but it is not completed until early adulthood, possibly as late as age 25. The last area of the nervous system to be myelinated is the prefrontal cortex, which is involved with judgment and morality (Hayak et al., 2001). Until myelin in this area is mature, these neurons do not work as efficiently, which is one of the possible reasons teenagers and adults sometimes make different decisions (Baird et al., 1999). You may recall some experiences from your early teens that appear shocking and overly risky to your adult brain. Worse yet, as you move through your 20s, you might find yourself agreeing more frequently with your parents.Now that we have a working knowledge of the structure of neurons, we are ready to talk about how they function. A neuron is a sophisticated communication and information-processing system that receives input, evaluates it, and decides whether to transmit information to neurons downstream. Its actions are similar to your own when you receive a juicy bit of gossip from a friend and then decide whether to tell somebody else. Myelination of the human nervous system takes more than 20 years to complete. As we mentioned earlier, neural communication is a two-step process. In the first step, which takes place in the signaling neuron’s axon, the neuron generates an electrical signal known as an action potentialaction potentialThe electrical signal arising in a neuron’s axon            action potential        The electrical signal arising in a neuron’s axon            . This signal travels the length of the axon from its junction with the cell body to its terminal. In the second step, which takes place between two neurons, the arrival of an action potential at the axon terminal of the first neuron signals the release of chemical messengers, which float across the extracellular fluid separating the two neurons. These chemicals influence the likelihood that the second neuron will respond with its own action potential, sending the message along. The production of action potentials can be demonstrated using axons dissected from a squid and placed in a tub of seawater, which has a chemical composition similar to the fluid surrounding our body cells (Hodgkin & Huxley, 1952). Of all the possible sources of axons on the Earth, why choose squid? Certain axons from a squid can be as much as 1 millimeter in diameter, large enough to see with the naked eye. The squid axon is also large enough that you can insert a recording electrode into its interior without disrupting its function. The readings from inside the axon can then be compared with readings from a recording electrode placed in the seawater. Some squid axons are large enough to be seen with the naked eye and remain active in a bath of seawater for hours. These features make studying neural activity in a squid axon relatively simple. When a neuron is not processing information, we say that it is at rest. When a cell is at rest, the difference between the readings from the interior of the axon and the external fluid is known as the resting potentialresting potentialThe measure of the electrical charge across a neural membrane when the neuron is not processing information.            resting potential        The measure of the electrical charge across a neural membrane when the neuron is not processing information.            . Our recording will show that the interior of the neuron is negatively charged relative to its exterior due to the different chemical composition of the intracellular and extracellular fluids. Let’s assume that our resting neuron now begins to receive chemical messages from another neuron, a process we discuss in more detail shortly. Neurons can respond to incoming chemical signals by becoming either depolarized or hyperpolarized. The word polarized means far apart, such as when political factions disagree. Being depolarized means we have moved closer together, and being hyperpolarized means we have moved even farther apart than before. In the case of neurons, depolarization means that the difference between the electrical charges of the extracellular and the intracellular recordings is decreasing. Hyperpolarization means that the difference is increasing. When a neuron is depolarized by sufficient input, it reaches a threshold for producing an action potential. A threshold is the point at which an effect, the action potential in this case, is initiated. Once this threshold is reached, the generation of an action potential is inevitable. Approaching the threshold for initiating an action potential is similar to pulling the trigger of a gun. As you squeeze the trigger, nothing happens until you reach a critical point. Once that critical point is reached, the gun fires, and there is nothing you can do to stop it. Reaching threshold initiates a sequence of events that reliably produces an action potential (see Figure 4.24). These events involve the opening and the closing of pores or channels in the neural membrane, which in turn allow certain chemicals to move into and out of the cell. These chemicals are in the form of ions or electrically charged particles dissolved in water. When threshold is reached, channels open, allowing one type of ion, sodium, to rush into the neuron. Because sodium ions carry a positive electrical charge, we can see their movement reflected in a steep rise in our recording of the difference between the internal and the external electrodes. At the peak of the action potential, our recording has reversed itself from the resting state. Now the interior of the cell is more positively charged than the outside. Once threshold is reached, an action potential is triggered. The movement of sodium and potassium ions across the axon membrane is reflected in the rise and fall of our recording, respectively. A refractory period follows each action potential, and triggering another action potential during this time is more difficult. Near the peak of the action potential, channels open that allow another type of ion, positively charged potassium, to move across the membrane. Potassium begins to leave the cell. As the interior loses these positively charged potassium ions, our recording heads in the negative direction again. Following the production of the action potential, the neuron requires a time-out or refractory period, during which it returns to its resting state. During this refractory period, the cell is unable or unlikely to respond to further input by producing another action potential. The size and shape of action potentials are always the same, whether we’re recording them in a squid or in a human. You won’t see recordings of short, fat action potentials or tall, skinny ones. Either an action potential occurs, or the cell remains at rest—there is no middle ground. Because of this consistency, we say that action potentials are all or none. Action potentials do not affect the entire axon all at once. The process we just described takes place first in a small segment of the axon where the axon connects to the cell body. The next step is propagation, or the duplication of the electrical signal down the length of the axon to the axon terminal, where it initiates the release of chemical messengers. We mentioned earlier that myelinated neurons enjoyed some advantages in efficiency and speed, and we are now ready to discuss why that is the case. Propagation takes place differently in myelinated and unmyelinated axons. In an unmyelinated axon, action potentials occur step by step, from one small section of the axon to the next adjacent section, down the entire length of the axon. In contrast, action potentials in myelinated axons are formed only at the sections of the axon membrane between adjacent segments of myelin, known as nodes of Ranvier. In other words, propagation in myelinated axons can skip the sections covered by myelin. You might think about propagation in unmyelinated versus myelinated axons as being similar to shuffling your feet versus taking long strides. Which covers the most ground faster and more efficiently?Sushi made from puffer fish, known as fugu, is a delicacy, but when prepared poorly, it can result in sickness or death. Chefs who prepare fugu undergo extensive training and licensing in Japan. The puffer fish toxin blocks the movement of sodium into cells, making electrical signaling impossible. As a result, diners who eat poorly prepared fugu can become paralyzed and suffocate to death. Propagation in unmyelinated axons works well, as evidenced by the wealth of invertebrate life on the Earth, from the snails in your garden to the giant squid of the oceans. These animals survive with no myelin, but their neural communication is not fast or energy efficient compared to ours. Forming action potentials at each section down the length of the axon is time consuming, like taking the local bus that stops at every block. In addition, cleaning up after all these action potentials uses a lot of energy (Swaminathan, Burrows, & McMurray, 1982). The more action potentials it takes to move a signal down the length of the axon, the more energy is expended returning the cell to its resting state. A node of Ranvier, located between two adjacent segments of myelin, is rich in sodium channels, which makes the formation of action potentials at the node possible. Propagation in myelinated axons is fast and efficient (see Figure 4.25). After an initial action potential is generated near the cell body, the current flows beneath a segment of myelin until it reaches a node of Ranvier, where another action potential occurs. Like the express bus, the action potentials skip the myelinated sections of the axon, reaching their destination, the axon terminal, about 20 times faster than if the axon were unmyelinated. By covering the same distance with fewer action potentials, the myelinated axon uses less energy returning to the resting potential than an unmyelinated axon would need. Action potentials move down the length of the myelinated axon more quickly than they move down an unmyelinated axon. Once the action potential reaches the axon terminal, the neural communication system switches from an electrical signaling system to a chemical signaling one. The point of communication between two neurons is known as a synapse. At the synapse, neurons do not touch one another physically. Instead, they are separated by tiny gaps filled with extracellular fluid. Because electrical signals are unable to jump this gap, neurons send chemical messengers instead. These chemical messengers are called neurotransmittersneurotransmittersA chemical messenger that communicates across a synapse.            neurotransmitters        A chemical messenger that communicates across a synapse.

The neurotransmitters in the axon terminal are contained in synaptic vesicles. The arrival of an action potential releases the vesicles from their protein anchors, much like boats leaving a dock, and the vesicles migrate rapidly to the cell membrane. Because the vesicles are made of the same thin, oily material as the membrane, they easily fuse with the membrane and spill their contents into the synaptic gap, similar to popping soap bubbles in a bathtub. Following release, the vesicles are pinched off the membrane and refilled. Because most neurons are separated from one another by extracellular fluid, the action potential cannot jump from one neuron to the next. To cross the gap between neurons, chemical signals are used instead. (a) Neurotransmitter release. The arrival of an action potential at the axon terminal triggers a sequence of events that results in the release of neurotransmitter molecules, which float across the synaptic gap to interact with receptors on the receiving neuron. (b) Reuptake. After interacting with receptors, neurotransmitter molecules are often recaptured by the neuron that released them to be recycled and used again later. Two axons (in purple) are forming synapses or junctions where communication will occur with a neuron’s cell body (in yellow). The neurotransmitters released across the synaptic gap come into contact with special channels on the receiving neuron, known as receptors. ReceptorsReceptorsA special channel in the membrane of a neuron that interacts with neurotransmitters released by other neurons.            Receptors        A special channel in the membrane of a neuron that interacts with neurotransmitters released by other neurons.             work with the neurotransmitters like locks and keys. Only a neurotransmitter with the right shape (the key) can attach itself or bind to a particular receptor (the lock). Neurotransmitters do not stay bound to receptors long. Once they pop out of the receptor binding site, neurotransmitter molecules drift away from the gap, are broken down by enzymes, or return to the axon terminal from which they were released in a process called reuptake. In reuptakereuptakeA process in which molecules of neurotransmitter in the synaptic gap are returned to the axon terminal from which they were released            reuptake        A process in which molecules of neurotransmitter in the synaptic gap are returned to the axon terminal from which they were released            , special channels in the axon terminal membrane known as transporters allow the neurotransmitters to move back into the releasing neuron where they are repackaged for later use. Many important drugs, including the antidepressant drug fluoxetine (Prozac), interfere with or inhibit this reuptake process. The interaction between neurotransmitters and their receptors can have one of two effects on the receiving neuron: excitation or inhibition. When a neurotransmitter has an excitatory effect, it slightly depolarizes the receiving neuron, increasing the likelihood that the neuron will reach threshold and initiate an action potential. Recall that depolarization reduces the difference between the electrical environments inside and outside the neuron. When a neurotransmitter has an inhibitory effect, it slightly hyperpolarizes the receiving neuron, moving the cell farther from threshold and reducing the likelihood that it will initiate an action potential. Recall that hyperpolarization increases the difference between the electrical environments inside and outside the neuron. Excitatory messages seem logical. One neuron is telling another to pass the message along. Inhibitory messages, however, seem somewhat strange at first glance. Why would our nervous systems need a message that says, Don’t pass the message along? Tetanus, for which you probably have been vaccinated, provides a dramatic example of what can happen when inhibition doesn’t work properly. The toxin produced by the bacteria responsible for tetanus selectively damages inhibitory neurons in the parts of the nervous system that control muscle contraction. Normally, excitatory inputs that contract muscles coordinate their activity with inhibitory inputs that tell muscles to relax, allowing the steady hands we need to put in a contact lens, for example. Without the input of the inhibitory neurons, the system is left with excitation only, and the result is the extreme muscle contraction that gives tetanus its other name—lockjaw (see Figure 4.27). The severe muscle contraction that gives tetanus its nickname of lockjaw results from the toxin’s blocking the release of inhibitory neurotransmitters in the motor systems of the brain and spinal cord. (a) Normally, inhibitory input balances contraction to maintain smooth movements. (b) Without the counterbalance of inhibition, too much muscle contraction occurs. The SSRI label for some antidepressant medications, including Prozac, stands for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. People who are depressed often have lower-than-normal serotonin activity at the synapse. If you inhibit reuptake of serotonin, more molecules remain in the synaptic gap longer where they can continue to interact with receptors. Serotonin activity increases, relieving depression, because we get more bang for the buck each time serotonin is released. Synapses usually occur in many locations on the dendrites or cell body of the receiving neuron, and the depolarizing or hyperpolarizing current that results from neurotransmitter activity at these synapses drifts to the junction of the cell body and axon. If there is sufficient depolarization to reach threshold at this junction, the neuron generates an action potential. If not, it remains at rest. The neuron’s decision to generate an action potential or not is called summation; the neuron is adding up all incoming messages and making a decision based on that information. The neuron’s task is not unlike the situation we face when we ask friends and family for advice. We will receive some excitatory advice (Go for it!), along with some inhibitory advice (Don’t even think about it!). Our job, like the neuron’s, is to sum our input and make a decision. Unlike us, however, the neuron cannot disregard the advice it receives.Researchers have identified more than 50 chemicals that serve as neurotransmitters. Table 4.4 lists some neurotransmitters that are particularly interesting to psychologists, and we will highlight a few of these in this section. In Chapter 6, we explore examples of psychoactive drugs, both therapeutic and recreational, that interact with the normal biochemistry of the nervous system. A Yagua hunter in Peru loads a dart tipped with curare into the mouthpiece of his blowgun. Curare is derived from native plants and causes paralysis by blocking receptors for acetylcholine (ACh) at synapses between the nervous system and the muscle fibers. Acetylcholine (ACh) is a neurotransmitter found in many systems important to behavior. ACh is found at the neuromuscular junction, the synapse at which the nervous system commands muscles. Interference with the action of ACh at the muscles can result in paralysis and death, making drugs that act on ACh popular for use as pesticides and as bioweapons. ACh also serves as a key neurotransmitter in the autonomic nervous system, discussed previously, which carries commands from the brain to the glands and organs. ACh is also intimately involved in the brain circuits related to learning and memory. These brain circuits are among the first to deteriorate in Alzheimer’s disease. Not surprisingly, memory deficits are among the earliest symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease to appear. Among the many drugs that act on ACh systems is the nicotine found in tobacco. Norepinephrine activity in the brain leads to arousal and vigilance. Consistent with this role in arousal, norepinephrine is also released by the sympathetic nervous system. As we observed previously, the sympathetic nervous system prepares us to react to emergencies by providing necessary resources, such as the extra oxygen that is needed to run or throw a punch. Abnormalities in norepinephrine activity have been implicated in several psychological conditions that feature disturbances in arousal and vigilance, including bipolar disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), discussed in Chapter 14. Dopamine is involved with systems that govern movement, planning, and reward. Parkinson’s disease, which makes normal movement difficult, results when dopamine-releasing neurons in the brain’s movement circuits begin to die. In addition, dopamine participates in the brain’s reward and pleasure circuits by becoming active whenever we engage in behaviors that promote survival and successful reproduction, such as eating a great meal or having sex. Most drugs that produce addiction, including cocaine and methamphetamine, stimulate increased activity in dopamine circuits. In Chapter 14, we will see how disruptions to dopamine circuits have been implicated in schizophrenia and ADHD. Serotonin is involved with systems regulating sleep, appetite, mood, and aggression. Consequently, these behaviors are tightly linked. As we will see in Chapter 14, people who experience depressed mood also show abnormalities in appetite and sleep. Sleep deprivation can result in changes in mood and appetite, even leading to significant overeating (Spiegel, Tasali, Penev, & Van Cauter, 2004). Botox, which is used to treat muscle spasms or reduce wrinkles, is made from an inactive form of the toxin responsible for botulism, which is produced by bacteria that spoil food. Botox interacts with ACh by preventing its release from the axon terminal. Without the activity of ACh telling a muscle to contract, the muscle remains paralyzed. Endorphins, short for endogenous morphine or morphine produced by the body, modify our natural response to pain. In evolutionary terms, it makes sense to have a system that reduces your chances of being disabled by pain during an emergency. All too frequently, however, we underestimate the extent of our injuries until we wake up the next morning feeling sore. Runner’s high, in which people who regularly engage in endurance sports experience a sense of well-being and reduced sensation of pain, results from the release of endorphins initiated by high levels of activity. Opioid drugs such as morphine, heroin, and oxycodone (OxyContin) produce their pain-relieving effects by mimicking the action of endorphins at the synapse. In other words, the opioid drugs are so similar in chemical structure to our natural endorphins that the receptors cannot tell them apart and treat the opioids as if they were natural endorphins. This image highlights areas of the human brain that are rich in receptors for endorphins, our natural opioids. The red areas have the most endorphin receptors, followed by the yellow areas. Opioid drugs, such as heroin or morphine, affect our behavior by interacting with these receptors. For many people, love and lust seem close together. Using the biological perspective, however, these two states look related yet distinct. On a neurochemical level, sexual desire or lust is driven primarily by levels of testosterone for males and levels of estrogens for females (Cappelletti & Wallen, 2016), while the bonding we associate with romantic love is largely associated with oxytocin (Diamond, 2004). This suggests that, at least on a hormonal level, it is possible to differentiate the two states. Further understanding of the relationship between lust and love comes from brain imaging research. Of particular interest is the insula, an area of cortex lining the lateral sulcus, which separates the temporal lobes from the frontal and parietal lobes. Pulling the temporal lobe away from the rest of the brain reveals the insula within the sulcus. As shown in Figure 4.28, researchers found that activation of the posterior (back) part of the insula is more closely associated with lust (Cacioppo, Bianchi-Demicheli, Frum, Pfaus, & Lewis, 2012). In contrast, these same researchers found that activation of the anterior or forward part of the insula is more associated with romantic feelings. They conclude that love grows out of and is a more abstract representation of the pleasant sensorimotor experiences that characterize desire (Cacioppo et al., 2012, p. 1048). Areas shown in blue are uniquely active during sexual desire, while areas shown in red are uniquely active during romantic love. One of the areas where activity reliably varies between the states of sexual desire and romantic love is the insula. Activity in the posterior insula (toward the back of the brain) is associated with sexual desire, while activity in the anterior insula (toward the front of the brain) is associated with romantic love. Additional support for the role of the anterior insula in love comes from a unique case study (Cacioppo et al., 2013). A male patient who had experienced damage to his anterior insula was asked to indicate whether a series of attractive individuals could be the object of his lust or his love. Compared to healthy control participants, the patient showed a selective deficit in his decisions about love yet performed normally on decisions about lust. The patient was similar to the controls in the number of people he categorized as objects of love or lust, and his response time to objects of lust appeared normal. However, his response time for categorizing objects of love was slower than that of the healthy controls. Should we conclude that the anterior insula is a love center of the brain? It would be better to conclude, as  Cacioppo et al. (2013) do, that the anterior insula participates in a larger network that helps us figure out internal states, which includes feelings of romantic love. Cyberbullying is unquestionably cruel. Empathy, or our ability to understand and share the feelings of others, usually prevents cruelty. If we imagine our responses to being cyberbullied, we are relatively less likely to cyberbully ourselves. An extreme failure in empathy characterizes the psychopath, discussed in Chapter 14. Empathy is a part of social cognition, or the spontaneous attribution of internal thoughts and emotions to other people, animals, and even objects. When social cognition is not engaged, people might instead respond with disinterest or disgust (Harris & Fiske, 2011). Consider how people respond while passing a homeless person on the street. You will make very different conclusions using social cognition (how would it feel to be that dirty and hungry?) as opposed to not engaging social cognition. Responding with disgust opens the door to dehumanizing the other. The online environment has features that make cruelty more likely (Runions & Bak, 2015). Distance between the bully and the victim diminishes the emotional impact of harming another person. In addition, the online environment offers fewer social cues, perhaps making it easier to dehumanize the victim and to underestimate their pain. These specific features of the online environment might support bullying by a person who would be less likely to cause harm in person. Neuroscientists have made progress in identifying the features of the brain that support social cognition and empathy. Perhaps most relevant to the question of cyberbullying is our capacity for sharing the pain of others, and brain circuits involved in pain are well understood. A circuit involving the somatosensory cortex in the parietal lobe helps us identify the location of a source of pain and its intensity (I just twisted my ankle and it’s a 6 on a pain scale of 1 to 10). Another circuit involving the insula and the anterior cingulate cortex is involved with our emotional responses to pain (Twisting my ankle is bringing tears to my eyes!). In general, these same circuits show similar activation when we empathize with someone in pain (see Figure 4.29). However, our tendency to empathize with others is moderated by a complicated set of cognitions, including judgments about whether the person is responsible for his or her own pain (Decety, Echols, & Correll, 2009). Empathy for others depends on complex cognitions, including how much responsibility a person has for their pain. These participants showed a larger response to observing a video of a person in pain when they were told the pain resulted from acquiring AIDS through a transfusion. Lesser responses were observed when the participants were told that the pain resulted from acquiring a virus while otherwise healthy or from acquiring AIDS through drug use. StructureWhat to rememberNeuronCell body: Contains the nucleus and carries out most housekeeping functions.
