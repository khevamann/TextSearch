Much of our Success as a Species can be attributed to our social nature. But as we all know from personal experience, the social world can be challenging; consider, if you can, some truly embarrassing memories about social mistakes that you’ve made. Our need to understand our complex social environment was one of the driving forces that shaped the development of our large human brains (Cacioppo & Decety, 2011). Among the social environments with the largest minefields is the connections that we make with others in intimate, romantic relationships. The two people in the photograph at left appear to find each other attractive, and they are engaged in behaviors—both variable and choreographed—designed to further their relationship. Looking at the developing relationship, psychologists can see a number of processes at work, such as first impressions and the effects of perceived similarities that are discussed in detail in this chapter. Zooming in, however, we see a different set of processes at work. Although most of us believe that we choose romantic partners on the basis of perceived attractiveness and compatibility, there is some chemistry at work here too. Overall, humans share more genes in common with spouses (Domingue, Fletcher, Conley, & Boardman, 2014) and friends (Christakis & Fowler, 2014) than they do with strangers. In some cases, however, being genetically different from your partner is desirable. The highlighted genes in the larger image help determine a person’s immune system response. Furthermore, variations of these genes, or alleles, are associated with different detectable body odors (Wedekind & Füri, 1997). As attractive and compatible as these individuals seem to each other, one might reject the other in response to this odor. Our evolutionary history has left us with the ability to detect a genetic compatibility in a partner, as well as more surface compatibilities. Individual humans are not that impressive, but cooperating in groups makes our species more capable. Zooming out from our couple, we see that their romance takes place within a larger social context. What will their families and friends think of their relationship? How do cultural attitudes and biases shape the likelihood of their success? To what extent will they feel comfortable conforming to these cultural expectations or rejecting them? These external factors can help determine the course of their relationship. Humans depend on one another. We sit in houses and offices built by contractors and laborers, work on computers designed and built by armies of engineers and technicians, eat food grown and transported by others, wear clothes made by people living halfway around the globe, and look forward to the next text message from a friend. As far back as the historical record goes, we have evidence that humans lived in groups. What advantages might cooperative living have provided to our early ancestors? As predators or fighters, individual humans have rather modest equipment relative to other species. Our teeth and nails are not particularly frightening, and we are frequently outmatched in speed and strength. It is our human abilities to think and to use tools, to employ and detect deceit, and to communicate, work together, and form alliances that make us such a formidable species. Early evolutionary pressures favored humans who chose to affiliate or associate with others, and by doing so, sculpted much of the social behavior that we observe today (Cacioppo, Cacioppo,  Cole et al., 2015;  Dunbar, 2011). Social interaction is not just a helpful option but is also a basic human need, which can be more powerful than other basic needs such as hunger, which is addressed in Chapter 7 (Cacioppo, Cacioppo, & Boomsma, 2014). A mother’s ability to comfort her infant through touch has a greater impact on the infant’s attachment to her than her ability to provide food (Harlow & Harlow, 1973). Study participants expecting a painful electric shock prefer the company of strangers to facing their fears alone (Schachter, 1959). We depend on today’s mobile technologies that allow us to carry our social networks wherever we go (Finkel, Eastwick, Karney, Reis, & Sprecher, 2012;  Przybylski & Weinstein, 2013). We not only need social contact, but also react negatively when social support is withdrawn (see Figure 13.1). Perceived social isolation shares similar risks of death with obesity and a sedentary lifestyle and is positively correlated with risk of suicide (Cacioppo, Cacioppo, Capitanio, & Cole, 2015;  Holt-Lunstad, Smith, Baker, Harris, & Stephenson, 2015). Disruptions of social connections through divorce, bereavement, separation, or ridicule are known to be among the most stressful experiences people may face (Williams, 2007). Perceived isolation, or loneliness, can initiate a cascade of negative interactions that further separate individuals from the social contact they need and want, interfere with the quality of sleep, increase feelings of negative mood and hostility, and lead to a heightened sensitivity to threat and attack (Cacioppo et al., 2015).  Cacioppo, Hawkley, & Thisted, 2010). The isolated person begins to behave in ways that are self-protective but that paradoxically push people away and promote further rejection and isolation. As a result, we are highly motivated to stay in the good graces of our social groups. In the remainder of this chapter, we will see how this need to maintain our social connectivity shapes many types of behavior, from the attitudes that we hold about brands of cereal to our responses as members of teams and committees. Psychologists have many ways to make study participants feel socially excluded for short periods so that they can evaluate the effects that social exclusion has on everything from brain activity to sharing cookies. Many experiments use this Cyberball game, developed by Kip Williams of Purdue University. The participant, represented by the little hand in the foreground, is initially included in the game of catch with the other two players, who are just part of a computer program. Midway through the game, the other players throw the ball between themselves, excluding the participant, whose little hand is left with nothing to do.1.

Our success in the social world begins with our ability to perceive the characteristics and intentions of others. What was your immediate reaction to your psychology professor on your first day of class? If you’re like most people, you came to some quick conclusions that are likely to last a long time. We form rapid and enduring first impressions of other people. When we say first impressions are formed rapidly, we are not talking about months, weeks, days, or hours, but in some cases, less than a minute. In a meta-analysis of research using thin slices of behavior (i.e., exposure lasting less than 30 seconds), initial impressions did not change much after longer periods of exposure (Ambady & Rosenthal, 1993). Speed-dating provides an interesting environment for observing the accuracy of these thin-slice impressions. Researchers asked men and women to participate in 3-minute social exchanges, followed by their rating each potential partner as date, friend, or no contact (Wilson, Cousins, & Fink, 2006). After only 3 minutes of observation, people accurately predicted their compatibility with a potential partner as measured by a reliable instrument called the compatibility quotient (CQ). If you have experienced pangs of loneliness during your time at college, you are not alone. University students are especially susceptible to loneliness (Cutrona, 1982). Why do we feel loneliness? It might have evolved to provide our ancestors with an early warning system that their social connectivity needed repair (Cacioppo, Cacioppo, Cole, & Capitano, 2015). The UCLA Loneliness Scale (Russell, 1996) is a standardized instrument that assesses a person’s subjective self-report of loneliness. The scale, found in Table 13.1, includes 20 items; after you complete them, we will tell you how to score and interpret your results. Adding up your scores: To obtain your final score, add up your responses to all the nonasterisked items. Then add up all the asterisked items and subtract this total from 45. You will notice that these items are reversals, in which the nonlonely answers are the higher numbers. Questionnaires use this strategy to keep someone from just picking the same number all the way through an instrument. Add the two sums together to find your total score, which can range from 20 to 80. Interpreting your score: Obviously, there are no right or wrong answers on an instrument like this, but higher numbers indicate higher levels of subjective loneliness. For comparison’s sake,  Russell (1996) administered this instrument to college students, nurses, and the elderly. The nurses had the highest scores (mean = 40.14), followed by college students (40.08) and older adults (31.51). It might surprise you that the college students felt more loneliness than the older adults! This is probably because loneliness results from one’s perceived disconnection, not absolute number of relationships. It is possible that college students have higher expectations for connectivity or that the elderly have had more time to establish meaningful relationships with others. If your score seems on the high side, don’t despair. Not only do psychological scientists understand quite a bit about loneliness, but they also have some empirically supported suggestions for alleviating it. One key to reducing feelings of loneliness is to understand how lonely people behave. Loneliness is associated with a number of maladaptive social cognitions, including increased sensitivity to social threats, better memory for negative social information, more negative social expectations, and behavior that confirms negative expectations. In other words, lonely people act in counterproductive ways that further drive them away from the social connectivity they seek (Cacioppo & Hawkley, 2009;  Cacioppo, Norris, Decety, Monteleone, & Nusbaum, 2009). Interventions designed to reverse those maladaptive cognitions were found to reduce loneliness better than other strategies in a large meta-analysis (Masi, Chen, Hawkley, & Cacioppo, 2011). We make quick assessments of others by focusing on a subset of traits and behaviors, rather than trying to sum up an entire person. In particular, people are likely to use faces to form impressions. Halo effects occur when one characteristic or a small number of characteristics have a large impact on overall perception. If people see characteristics that they value or dislike, they tend to make simple thumbs-up or thumbs-down assessments. One person might be attracted to blue eyes, and another might be turned off by tattoos. In one study, students hearing a professor described as warm instead of cold were willing to say after a brief encounter that he was a more effective teacher, less ruthless, and more humorous (Widmeyer & Loy, 1988). Speed dating, in which people have a limited time to decide whether they would like further contact with another person, takes advantage of the rapid assessments of one another that we make. After only 30 seconds of contact, people make enduring evaluations of other people. First impressions are not only fast, but also persistent. Once we have reached a conclusion about a person, even after a brief social exchange in a speed-dating experiment, we tend to stick with that assessment for a long time. Most of us have formed a false first impression of others (either overly positive or overly negative) that breaks down only after extensive further exposure, if at all. However, in the face of certain types of new information, first impressions do change (Brannon & Gawronski, 2016;  Mann & Ferguson, 2017). It would not be very adaptive to hold onto a false impression indefinitely, so it makes sense to think that we also have the ability to update our beliefs. Although the tendency to make first impressions may be characteristic of all humans, our abilities to shape accurate judgments are also influenced by culture. As shown in Figure 13.2, Japanese and American participants successfully used their first impressions to predict which political candidates would win an upcoming election, but their predictions were more accurate for candidates from their own culture (Rule et al., 2010). Can you pick which of these candidates won or lost their elections?* Apparently, people can do this quite well, but they perform better within their own cultures. Based on viewing the photos of candidates’ faces, without recognizing the candidate or even knowing that the person was running for office, Americans did a good job of predicting the outcome of an election for unfamiliar American candidates for the U. S. Senate but did not do as well when predicting the outcome for Japanese candidates for the shugi-in (the Japanese equivalent of the U. S. House of Representatives). Japanese participants predicted the success of Japanese candidates, but most of the American candidates who they expected to win ended up losing.*The two on the left won; the two on the right lost. Group ProcessDefinitionExampleSocial facilitationIndividual performance is influenced by the presence of others. A jogger runs faster with a buddy than when running alone. Social loafing Working in a group decreases individual effort. A student puts less effort into a group project than into an individual term paper. Deindividuation Behavior differs when in a group, as opposed to when alone and identifiable. A normally law-abiding citizen loots a store during a riot. Group polarization Attitudes become more intense following discussion. After a late-night debate with like-minded friends, students hold more extreme views about an issue than they did before the discussion. Groupthink Flawed group decision making fails to consider dissenting views. A group of friends decides to engage in a risky behavior that seems dumb in hindsight. We not only size up other people quickly in terms of their personal characteristics, but also ask why they behave the way they do. Being able to predict the behavior of others has significant survival value. Our answers to questions about why others behave in certain ways are attributionsattributionsA judgment about the cause of a person’s behavior.            attributions        A judgment about the cause of a person’s behavior.            , or judgments about the causes of other people’s behavior.

(external) factors (Heider, 1958). For example, if your friend just flunked an important exam, you could try to answer the question Why? by considering your friend’s personal characteristics and circumstances. In considering your friend’s disposition, you might recall that she is anxious (being anxious is dispositional), which might have interfered with her performance on a stressful test. In considering your friend’s situation, you remember that she just broke up with her romantic partner of several years (breaking up is situational), which was depressing and distracting for her as she prepared for her test. Thinking that disposition and situation act in an either/or fashion instead of interacting to produce an outcome is no more helpful to our understanding of behavior than using either/or thinking in considering nature and nurture (Funder, 2009;  Johnson, 2009). However, as will be shown in the next section, the weight placed on dispositional and situational variables as explanations for behavior can vary dramatically from one case to the next. Although our attributions typically guide us in the right direction, we do make errors. We are not able to read minds, so we must make a logical leap from what we observe in a person’s behavior to the internal state of mind that produced it. However, sometimes that leap takes us in the wrong direction. When you hear about people flunking a test, you are likely to start making conclusions about their dispositions (she is a lazy student or he is not very smart), even though you are quite aware that the professor giving the test has a reputation for writing brutal exams. This willingness to infer a person’s disposition from observed behavior, even when strong situational factors are obvious, is known as the correspondence biascorrespondence biasThe tendency to view behavior as the result of disposition, even when the behavior can be explained by the situation in which it occurs            correspondence bias        The tendency to view behavior as the result of disposition, even when the behavior can be explained by the situation in which it occurs             (Gilbert & Jones, 1986;  Gilbert & Malone, 1995). In other words, we usually expect people’s behavior to correspond to their dispositions, even when we know for sure that the situation is having a powerful effect. Given the importance of making accurate attributions to our survival and social relationships, why would such a bias ever occur? Psychologists are still debating the reasons for this error. One possibility might be the genuine stability of personality traits (discussed in Chapter 12). Although traits interact with situations to produce behavior, people often believe that the You did it because that is the kind of person you are explanation is accurate. There is some truth to these beliefs, which is why they persist. But at the same time, our discussion of personality has shown that situations make important contributions to behavior. You might consider yourself to be a helpful person, but you might ignore someone with a flat tire when you’re late for class or work. Are the famous Wal-Mart greeters really friendly people? Or are they just doing their jobs? Because of the correspondence bias, we tend to view Wal-Mart greeters as friendly people, even though we fully understand that their jobs require them to act this way. Other factors that contribute to correspondence bias include a lack of awareness of the power of the situation and unrealistic beliefs about how situations should affect people (Gilbert & Malone, 1995). In many everyday instances, we simply do not have enough information about somebody’s circumstances to consider situational variables in our attributions. A grumpy, unenthusiastic professor might be having health or personal problems of which students in the classroom are unaware, but by default, the students believe that the professor is characteristically grumpy and unenthusiastic. In other cases, we seem to misjudge the likelihood that typical people will respond to a situation in a certain way. Later in this chapter, you will learn how a majority of individuals were willing to electrocute another participant simply because they were told to do so by an experimenter. You might think, I would never respond to the situation like that, which might lead to your misjudging the power of the situation. A concept closely related to the correspondence bias is known as the fundamental attribution error (FAE; Ross, 1977). According to this view, people do not underestimate situational variables as proposed by correspondence bias, but instead completely fail to consider situational variables while making attributions. By default, this total neglect of situational influences leads to a reliance on dispositional contributions to explain the resulting observed behavior. Research evidence for such a consistent neglect of observed situational variables is lacking (Gawronski, 2004). For example, in the study mentioned earlier about administering shock, how do you think people view the minority of participants who did not comply? If we globally ignore situational variables, as required by the FAE, we should attribute the behavior of these individuals to their strong moral character (disposition), but this is not what usually happens (Gilbert & Malone, 1995). Instead, most people attribute the minority’s behavior to simply responding to the situation the way people ought to do. The situation still plays a significant role in people’s interpretation of the observed behavior, which is inconsistent with the premises of the FAE. This leaves the correspondence bias as the superior explanation for how people balance their assessments of disposition and situation. The correspondence bias is not the only flaw in our judgment of behavior. When our personal needs and motives enter the picture, additional errors can occur. Classic studies suggested that an actor–observer biasactor–observer biasEmphasizing dispositional attributions to explain the behavior of others while emphasizing situational attributions to explain our own behavior.            actor–observer bias        Emphasizing dispositional attributions to explain the behavior of others while emphasizing situational attributions to explain our own behavior.             occurs when we use situational variables to explain our own behavior while continuing to use dispositional variables to explain the behavior of others (Jones & Nisbett, 1972): If my friend and I both flunked a test, I flunked because I was sick, but my friend flunked because he’s not a very hard worker. Although this suggestion has some intuitive appeal, a more recent meta-analysis suggested that people judge their own behavior similarly to the behavior of others (Malle, 2006). Olympic figure skater Rachael Flatt told a newspaper, I was ultimately responsible for my work, no one else! No excuses! And, that is true in daily training. I am responsible for my own work, no one else. Elite athletes like Flatt rarely indulge in the self-serving bias, in which we attribute our successes to dispositional qualities (I’m a talented athlete) and our failures to situations (the judging wasn’t fair or the ice wasn’t prepared properly). By avoiding this bias, athletes can learn from their mistakes and continue to improve their performances. Because of a self-serving biasself-serving biasAttributing success to dispositional factors while attributing failure to situational factors            self-serving bias        Attributing success to dispositional factors while attributing failure to situational factors            , we view our successes differently than our failures (Miller & Ross, 1975). When we succeed, we are more likely to attribute our success to dispositional variables. For example, if you get an A in this course, you are likely to congratulate yourself for your brains and hard work. In contrast, if you fail the course, it is because of situational factors, such as the professor’s asking unfair questions on the final exam. The self-serving bias can make you feel better, but it also can make it harder to learn from experience. Elite athletes, for example, are less likely than less successful athletes to use situational variables to excuse poor performance, such as blaming the weather when they lose a game (Roesch & Amirkhan, 1997). By considering their own contributions to failure, elite athletes can make the adjustments necessary for future success. It is Erroneous to Assume that large populations, like the people of China, are all alike, yet many cross-cultural psychologists have assumed that Chinese culture is uniformly collectivist. Not only is this not the case, but researchers also have suggested some novel contributing factors to explain the variations in social structure that can be observed. For example, differences in the type of crops that you raise is probably not the first variable that comes to mind when we consider differences in individualism and collectivism, yet this variable seems to play a role (Talhelm et al., 2014). The Question: Does the type of crop farmed predict the tendencies of a culture to be collectivist or individualist? More than 1,000 Han Chinese students in six areas of China (see Figure 13.3) completed measures of cultural thought, implicit individualism, and loyalty/nepotism. None of the measures were self-report because the researchers expressed concerns that the students would feel the need to answer in socially appropriate ways. For example, the cultural thought task asks the participants to decide which two items out of a group of three go together. If we asked you to do this for train, bus, tracks, what would you choose? People from individualistic cultures tend to make abstract pairings, such as train and bus, which belong to the same category. People from collectivistic cultures tend to make more holistic pairings, such as train and tracks, because they share a functional relationship. The responses of the students were analyzed in terms of their location in the wheat-growing north of China or the rice-growing south. Raising rice requires high levels of cooperation (a married couple cannot grow the rice needed to support a family by themselves), but growing wheat requires less, so the authors expected more collectivist responses from southern students than from northern students. The authors quoted a 17th-century Chinese farming guide that says, If one is short of labor, it is best to grow wheat. Han Chinese living in areas that have historically farmed rice scored higher on holistic thinking and were less likely to disrupt social organization through divorce than Han Chinese living in areas that have historically farmed wheat. Chinese protections for research participants are similar to those in the United States, but there are some concerns about how these translate to a different culture. Participants who are expected to put the collective good ahead of their individual interests might participate when they otherwise would prefer not to. The researchers tested their rice explanation against other potential explanations, such as the influence of pathogens or modernization. They found that the rice theory was the only one that consistently fit the cultural data. People from provinces that traditionally farmed rice performed more collectively and holistically, while people from provinces that traditionally farmed wheat performed more individualistically and analytically. The participants were unlikely to have ever engaged in farming, but traditional farming practices had shaped their cultural values nonetheless. A history of having to cooperate to survive might have shaped the local culture for centuries. These results also remind us that simple answers to psychological problems are usually not the best. Rather than thinking of East Asia as a consistent whole, it is more accurate and interesting to investigate the nuances of behavioral differences within cultures. Similar attribution errors occur at the group level (Forsyth & Schlenker, 1977). In a group-serving bias, an organization tends to attribute success to its dispositional characteristics but blames failures on the situation. If a sports team wins, most members attribute the victory to team disposition, such as talent, good preparation, or sheer will. If the team loses, the members are unlikely to blame the loss on team dispositional factors (Sherman & Kim, 2005). By failing to consider dispositional factors that might be remedied in the future, a group might miss opportunities to correct its course of action. In addition to self-serving bias, we frequently engage in other types of defensive reasoning. It is a short step from Your behavior reflects your disposition to causal judgments about the outcomes of behavior, such as You get what you deserve. Through the just-world beliefjust-world beliefThe assumption that good things happen to good people and bad things happen to bad people.            just-world belief        The assumption that good things happen to good people and bad things happen to bad people.            , people assume that good things happen to good people and bad things happen to bad people (Lerner & Miller, 1978). When you see something bad happen to a good person, you might reduce your anxiety by thinking that the person must have done something to deserve the bad outcome and that you can avoid that outcome by behaving differently. However, this reduction in personal anxiety can come at the expense of the victim, who is being blamed unfairly. Strong just-world beliefs have been positively correlated with negative attitudes toward the poor, people with HIV/AIDS, the elderly, and the unemployed (Sutton & Douglas, 2005). A just-world belief leads people to expect good things to happen to good people and bad things to happen to bad people. A strong just-world belief might lead people to blame-the-victim thinking, making them less sympathetic to the poor and the sick. There are subtle differences in attribution between cultures that value individualism and cultures that value collectivism. Individualistic cultures, including the United States and many other Western nations, stress individual achievement and competition. Collectivistic cultures, including those in many Asian nations, traditionally have valued cooperation as a means of attaining family and work group goals. Members of collectivistic cultures tend to place more emphasis on situation than on disposition (Choi, Nisbett, & Norenzayan, 1999;  Ho & Fung, 2011). For example, in the United States, murder is viewed as resulting from the disposition of the murderer, whereas in China, murder is often described in terms of the histories of the people involved and the situation in which the murder occurred (Morris & Peng, 1994). As a result, members of individualistic cultures are more likely to demonstrate the correspondence bias in evaluating crime. These cultural differences in attribution may be rooted in the tendency for people in Eastern cultures to focus on context or situations and relationships, while people in Western cultures are more likely to focus on objects than on situations (Masuda & Nisbett, 2001). As mentioned earlier, we tend to attribute behavior to the factors that we perceive. If being raised in a particular culture leads you to focus on different features of the environment, the attributions that are made vary accordingly (see Figure 13.4). In the individualist U. S. culture, but not in collectivist Singapore, recognition of peer pressure leading to crime (a situational variable) reduces the attribution of the crime to a person’s disposition. An American criminal who commits a crime because of peer pressure is not seen to be as bad as a person who acts without such pressure. As a result, extenuating circumstances usually lead to reduced sentences in the United States. Even though collectivist nations like Singapore place a higher emphasis on situational variables when making attributions overall, they do not view peer pressure as a reason to reduce punishment of an individual. If anything, the individual will be blamed for associating with the wrong peer group. Because of the importance placed on individual achievement in individualistic societies, members of these societies are more likely to use defensive attributions, such as self-serving bias (Leung, Kim, Zhang, Tam, & Chiu, 2011). Members of more collectivistic cultures show an interesting group-serving bias, in which they attribute more success to the group than it deserves and less failure than it deserves (Leung et al., 2011). That is, if you were raised in a collectivistic culture, you would show the same attributional biases about your in-group as individuals raised in an individualistic culture would show about themselves. To survive, all animals must make appropriate approach or avoidance responses to stimuli. The reflexes, fixed action patterns, and unconditioned responses discussed in Chapter 8 provide some guidance in simple situations, such as seeing a predator. To respond to more complex situations, humans form attitudesattitudesA positive or negative evaluation that predisposes behavior toward an object, person, or situation.            attitudes        A positive or negative evaluation that predisposes behavior toward an object, person, or situation.            , or favorable or unfavorable evaluations that predispose behavior (Petty & Cacioppo, 1986a). Attitudes are pervasive. We form positive and negative attitudes about everything from world events to celebrities to brands of peanut butter, and attitudes provide an efficient means of communicating with others. If a friend asks you for a recommendation for a movie, restaurant, or class, a simple attitude statement (I liked my psychology class!) can serve as a quick and efficient summary for a wide set of beliefs, behavioral experiences, and emotions. Decision making is simpler, faster, and less stressful when attitudes exist to serve as a guide. Attitudes can influence behavior, which is why the advertising industry spends billions of dollars each year in an attempt to shape your attitudes toward various products. Because we depend on our attitudes to guide our behavior, we want to make sure that they are correct (Festinger, 1950). Imagine what would happen if you woke up one day to discover that your attitudes about people, objects, and issues were all wrong. Suddenly your closest friends would dislike you, your major would be a poor match for your interests and abilities, and your entire collection of music would sound dreadful. Occasional mistakes happen, but holding accurate attitudes makes it easier for us to maneuver through environments successfully. Attitudes share three basic elements: affect (i.e., emotion), behavior, and cognition (the ABCs). For example, how might your attitudes about your college major be affected by hearing a negative news report about the job market for new college graduates in that field? The affective aspect of an attitude addresses emotional responses to the object. This information about your future job prospects could make you feel quite helpless, frightened, or angry. Behavior reflects the way that people respond to the object. After hearing the news, you might schedule an appointment with your adviser to discuss ways that you can pursue the subjects you love and still have a great career. The cognitive aspect of an attitude includes beliefs about the object. In response to this news, you might believe that you have chosen the wrong major. If you have any doubt whether people are emotional about their attitudes, just ask some friends whether they prefer an Apple (represented by the late Steve Jobs, left) or a PC (represented by Bill Gates, right). Be prepared to duck for cover. We form many attitudes on the basis of our personal experiences. You like a flavor of ice cream after sampling it, and you dislike the parking situation at your school because you can never find a spot near your classes. In other cases, we absorb attitudes from our contacts with peers, parents and other family members, religious leaders, teachers, and the media. We often adopt the attitudes of those around us to strengthen our chances of being socially included. As a result, many people prefer to stay on the winning side by forming attitudes based on how frequently they hear an opinion expressed by others and in the media (Noelle-Neumann, 1984). Later in this chapter, we explore how fear of social rejection also can lead to conformity and strict adherence to social norms or values. The learning principles explored in Chapter 8 play important roles in the development of attitudes. Operant conditioning suggests that approval or disapproval shapes a person’s attitudes. An opinion expressed in class that is followed by nods and claps will be repeated in the future more than one that is met with horror and disgust. Because of classical conditioning, you are likely to form positive attitudes toward stimuli associated with positive outcomes. If a song is popular at a happy time of your life, it is likely that your subsequent attitude toward the song will be positive too. Observational learning also can be a powerful mechanism for learning attitudes. Children who are exposed to particular attitudes in their homes, communities, and media duplicate them, especially if they observe the person expressing the attitude being rewarded. Can attitudes be influenced by genetics? Identical twins who were adopted by different families at birth, making it unlikely that they were exposed to the same attitudes, still show a surprising amount of similarity in their attitudes as adults (Bouchard, Lykken, McGue, Segal, & Tellegen, 1990). You might have noticed that certain social, political, and religious attitudes seem to follow consistent patterns in the people you know. In other words, a person who holds liberal social and political attitudes is unlikely to hold traditional religious attitudes. Twin studies suggest that this range of attitudes can be explained by a single dimension—traditionalism versus nontraditionalism—which appears to be quite heritable (Ludeke, Johnson, & Bouchard, 2013). Some of our attitudes result from personal experience, but others are quickly absorbed from the world around us, especially through peers and the media. Although our attitudes typically guide us well, attitude change is often desirable. After all, we are sometimes flat-out wrong. Addiction, for example, includes attitudes and preferences that are not in the best interests of anybody concerned. The addict by definition cannot easily change these attitudes and preferences, however. Similarly, people who are unable to change their attitudes in the face of new evidence can be quite handicapped. Understanding the circumstances in which attitude change takes place gives us additional insight into the formation of our attitudes and their role in guiding our behavior. Cognitive dissonance helps explain why hazing, or requiring an unpleasant initiation to become a member of a group, increases the value of the group (Aronson & Mills, 1959). If you choose to endure so much to join, the group must be something special. Cognitive dissonanceCognitive dissonanceThe uncomfortable state that occurs when behavior and attitudes do not match and that can be resolved through attitude change            Cognitive dissonance        The uncomfortable state that occurs when behavior and attitudes do not match and that can be resolved through attitude change             provides a powerful tool for producing attitude change (Festinger, 1957). Cognitive dissonance is an uncomfortable state that occurs when our outward behavior doesn’t match our attitudes. For example, you might have been accepted by several colleges and universities, but you can choose to attend only one. Thinking about the positive features of the schools you reject causes dissonance (I like these schools, but I didn’t choose them), which could be resolved either by becoming a superfan of your chosen school or by forming negative attitudes toward the schools that you reject. How could you even consider making another choice? Who would want to go to those other schools? For attitude change to occur as result of cognitive dissonance, we must attribute our actions to our own voluntary, free will. In an early demonstration of cognitive dissonance (Festinger & Carlsmith, 1959), students completed two boring tasks (putting empty spools on a tray, emptying the tray, then filling it again; turning square pegs one quarter-turn at a time). Afterward, they were asked to tell another person that the tasks were fun. This should produce some level of cognitive dissonance (I publicly said the tasks were fun, but I really think they’re boring). The researchers offered to pay $1 (about $8.35 in 2017 dollars) or $20 (about $167.08 in 2017 dollars) to participants for saying that the tasks were fun. In contrast to students who were neither paid nor asked to say that the tasks were fun (the control group), the students paid $1 rated the tasks as much more fun. Interestingly, rating of the tasks’ enjoyability by the students paid $20, who could easily have justified that behavior (I’m being paid well to do this), did not differ from the controls. Brain imaging studies provide substantial support for cognitive dissonance (see Figure 13.5). Many people undergoing functional magnetic brain imaging (fMRI) find being confined in the scanner tube and the loud banging of the magnets to be unpleasant. Still, in one study, participants undergoing fMRI were asked to describe the somewhat unpleasant scanner experience as pleasant (van Veen, Krug, Schooler, & Carter, 2009). Levels of activity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and insula were higher when a participant made dissonant statements about how pleasant the fMRI experience was compared to neutral statements. Subsequent research has confirmed that the ACC is often engaged during episodes of cognitive conflict, while activity in areas of the insula corresponds to negative arousal (Kitayama, Chua, Tompson, & Han, 2013). Study participants undergoing fMRI were divided into two groups: a dissonance group, which was asked to tell the next participant how pleasant the rather unpleasant scanning experience was; and a control group, which did not discuss pleasantness. Both groups responded to target sentences, such as I feel calm, peaceful in the scanner, or neutral sentences, which did not involve attitudes toward the scanner experience. (a) The dissonance group responded to the target sentences with more activation in several parts of the brain, including the ACC and the insula (located at the junction of the temporal and frontal lobes), compared to the control group. (b) The groups did not show differences in response to the neutral sentences. (c) The yellow–orange areas are more active during the dissonance situation (dissonant group responding to target sentences) than during the other situations (dissonant group responding to neutral sentences or control group responding to target and neutral sentences). Cognitive dissonance, which focuses on conflicts between attitudes and behaviors, is part of a broader phenomenon—our need for cognitive consistencycognitive consistencyA preference for holding congruent attitudes and beliefs.            cognitive consistency        A preference for holding congruent attitudes and beliefs.             (Gawronski & Brannon, 2017). We form many associations between ideas, which in turn lead to expectations. Discomfort caused by conflicts among these ideas might help us recognize errors in our belief systems. You might believe very strongly that being vegan will make people healthier, and your friend wants to be healthy, but she is not vegan. To resolve this inconsistency, one of these ideas needs to change. You might now believe that it’s possible to be healthy without being vegan, your friend really doesn’t want to be healthy, or your friend really is vegan and just doesn’t want her family to know. Aversive feelings that we experience when our ideas are inconsistent might motivate us to think more deeply about our beliefs. Choosing to smoke despite constant warning messages can produce cognitive dissonance. To reduce dissonance, this smoker may start to think that the warnings are not believable and that smoking isn’t that bad for you. Cognitive dissonance can produce attitude change, but it does not occur in response to a direct effort by another person. When we change our attitudes in response to information provided by others, persuasionpersuasionA change in attitude in response to information provided by another person.            persuasion        A change in attitude in response to information provided by another person.             occurs. Knowing how to persuade others and understanding the efforts of others to persuade you are important life skills. The elaboration likelihood model (ELM)elaboration likelihood model (ELM)A model that predicts responses to persuasive messages by distinguishing between the central and the peripheral route to persuasion.            elaboration likelihood model (ELM)        A model that predicts responses to persuasive messages by distinguishing between the central and the peripheral route to persuasion.             organizes and predicts our responses to persuasive messages by recognizing two major pathways leading to changes in attitudes (Petty & Cacioppo, 1981). The first, known as the central route to persuasion, occurs when a person considers persuasive arguments carefully and thoughtfully. The second, known as the peripheral route to persuasion, occurs when a person responds to peripheral cues, as described in the following section, without considering the quality of the argument carefully. Importantly, attitudes achieved through the central route are more enduring, more resistant to counterpersuasion, and more predictive of behavior than are attitudes achieved through the peripheral route (Petty & Cacioppo, 1986b). Why do we need two systems for responding to persuasive messages? Ideally, we would use the central route to consider all messages that we encounter. However, given our limited time, knowledge, and cognitive resources, a thorough evaluation of all the messages that we perceive is not practical. Using the peripheral route allows us to use heuristics, or rules of thumb (as described in Chapter 10), to react promptly to many situations. If you feel overwhelmed by the large number of candidates on your ballot, you might use the heuristic of voting along party lines or voting like your friends. Experts attending a technology trade show are likely to use the central route to persuasion while evaluating the speaker’s message. They will concentrate on the logic of the message and will be relatively unimpressed by peripheral cues, such as the speaker’s attractiveness or use of emotion. What determines whether we use the central or peripheral route? According to the ELM, a person’s motivation influences which route is used to evaluate a particular argument. When students are highly motivated to take time out of their busy schedules to attend a presentation by a guest speaker on campus because they know and care about the topic of the lecture, they are likely to use the central route and evaluate the speaker’s points carefully. People are also likely to use the central route to persuasion when they are well educated about a topic. However, even people who are knowledgeable occasionally take the peripheral rather than the central route. If you know about a topic but do not have the time to think about it or don’t care about it, you might find the shortcuts provided by the peripheral route more useful. In addition, because using the central route requires so many cognitive resources, including attention, we are less likely to process persuasive messages this way when we are distracted by other information or activities. As you concentrate on driving down a busy highway, you do not have the cognitive resources to evaluate the messages on billboards carefully. If a person is using the peripheral route to persuasion, what cues might influence the amount of attitude change that occurs? Peripheral cues usually apply to the persuasive message (e.g., the number of arguments), the manner in which the message is presented (e.g., speed of speech and accent), or the characteristics of the speaker (e.g., credibility or celebrity). Emotional appeals can influence people using the peripheral route. Both positive and negative emotions can enhance persuasion. Students asked to read persuasive messages about topics such as curing cancer and the state of military forces were more likely to agree with the statement they read while happily snacking on Pepsi and peanuts (Dabbs & Janis, 1965). Efforts to persuade using negative emotions are especially common. We hear daily warnings about the dangers of drinking too much, not using our seatbelts, engaging in risky sex practices, riding a bicycle without a helmet, eating trans fats, and so on. Arousing negative emotions, such as fear, can be risky. If people are too frightened by a message, they go into a state of denial. It’s really not that bad, they will say, or That can’t happen here. Denial is most likely to occur if the audience is not given an action to do to reduce their anxiety. It is fine to scare smokers to death about the appearance of their lungs, so long as you include a message that tells them where to get help to quit smoking. Having a sense of control over their response will reduce the fear and make the message more persuasive (Ajzen, 1991). Driving down a busy highway requires your full attention, making it unlikely that you will have the resources you need to evaluate persuasive messages using the central route. Instead, the advertisements that you pass on the road attempt to influence you in a few seconds to think better of the product that they are boosting or the message that they display. A positive response to the speaker can enhance a message’s persuasion. Despite the common-sense warning that beauty is only skin deep, people have a deep-seated stereotype that what is beautiful is good (Dion, Berscheid, & Walster, 1972). Student evaluations of a professor are heavily influenced by the perceived attractiveness of the professor (Hamermesh & Parker, 2005). People are more likely to be persuaded by people they like and with whom they share some similarity (Cialdini, 2001;  Van Knippenberg & Wilke, 1992). Similarities need not be substantial to produce this effect; study participants who shared a first name or birthday with the supposed author of a persuasive essay were more likely to agree with the essay (Silvia, 2005). The less a speaker stands to gain by persuading you, the more credibility the speaker appears to have. We understand that athletes and other celebrities are being paid large amounts of money to advertise particular products, so we tend to discount their opinions (Moore, Mowen, & Reardon, 1994). A testimonial by someone who has nothing to gain by speaking in favor of a product or issue is more persuasive. As a result of these findings, bloggers must disclose whether they are being compensated for writing about a brand. Without this information, we might not evaluate their arguments correctly. A credible speaker is usually more persuasive, especially when listeners are traveling the peripheral route. In turn, credibility is based on the speaker’s perceived expertise and trustworthiness. Expertise is often established by a person’s history and credentials. We suspect that your psychology professors would look different to you if they indicated that their degrees were in other subjects and that they really didn’t know much about psychology. Persuasion is also influenced by the medium used to communicate a message, from the face-to-face presentation of the door-to-door salesperson (a rarity these days) to print media, social media, the Internet, and movies and television. Typically, we find that the more a medium resembles a live interaction with another person, the more effective it is in transmitting a persuasive message. In general, face-to-face contact remains more effective than the use of other media (Bavelas, Hutchinson, Kenwood, & Matheson, 1997). This arrangement is the most natural way for humans to communicate. Not only is face-to-face communication the first medium we learn in childhood, but various technologies allowing communication at a distance developed at much later points in human history. Children are more likely than adults to respond to persuasive messages emotionally rather than logically, making them more susceptible to persuasion. Threatened with lawsuits from public interest groups, several major U. S. food companies agreed to reduce their marketing to children and to make products that appeal to children healthier. Finally, the age and intelligence of an audience can influence the effectiveness of a persuasive message. Young children are more likely to respond to persuasive arguments emotionally rather than logically, which might make them more susceptible to attitude change (and advertising) than adults. Intelligent, well-educated audiences are more difficult to persuade in most situations (Rhodes & Wood, 1992). Again, the influence of cues related to the message, speaker, medium, or audience is greatest when people are using the peripheral route to persuasion. When people are using the central route, their focus remains on the quality of the arguments being presented. The internet has provided new ways for people to communicate, from the use of webcams, video, and live chat to Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and blogs. Many of these new technologies have advantages in providing immediacy and collaboration. To the extent that they duplicate the advantages of face-to-face communication, we would expect them to provide effective means of persuading others. The Internet not only provides a new medium for communicating persuasive messages, but also challenges the status of credible, expert sources. Digital sources of news currently rank second only to television, and twice as many adults see news online compared to seeing news in print (Matsa & Lu, 2016). Historically, persuasive messages from traditional news outlets such as newspapers, magazines, radio, and television were more of a one-way street. However, in an environment in which everybody with a computer can produce information, receivers of information can be influencers as well by sharing and commenting on messages in blogs and on social networking sites. Research in this area suggests that user-generated content in the form of blogs, uploaded videos, comments, and reviews is considered as credible and accurate as formal news reports prepared by professional journalists (Lee, Park, Lee, & Cameron, 2010). In addition, knowing that content is popular with other users significantly raises a message’s impact (Steyn, Wallstrom, & Pitt, 2010). As more people depend on online sources for their information, psychologists and other professionals have expressed concerns about the quality of that information. So-called fake news is not a new concept, but the ability of the Internet to spread it brings a whole new dimension to its ability to persuade large numbers of people. At risk are people’s collective memories, or our shared understanding of what really happened. Fake news can occur in both traditional and online sources, but in the online domain, the term usually refers to sensational stories that are used to lure readers to a site to gain ad revenue. Among the most widely spread fake news stories of 2016 included Obama signs executive order banning the pledge of allegiance in schools nationwide (with 2,177,000 Facebook shares, comments, and reactions) and Pope Francis shocks world, endorses Donald Trump for President, releases statement (with 961,000 Facebook shares, comments, and reactions). About 16% of Americans have admitted to having shared fake news by mistake (Barthel, Mitchell, & Holcomb, 2016), and an alarming number seem to think satirical sites like The Onion post real news stories. While many people seem to have difficulty distinguishing between fake and real news, the critical thinking steps outlined in Chapter 2 are a good place to start. In addition, it can be helpful to search for information about the source, the author, and the date of the story. Some people actually mistake satire and jokes for real news, so if something sounds especially far-fetched, it might just be a joke. Again, we see the power of the social group in shaping our ideas (see Figure 13.6). Emerging interactions between new social media and credibility are likely to continue changing the landscape of persuasion. Social media, with their ability to make users into spokespeople, raise new issues for our understanding of speaker credibility in persuasion. Different age groups have embraced user-generated content, such as blogs, tweets, and articles shared on Facebook, to different degrees. Younger age groups are as likely to say they would comply with a food recall message posted on their Facebook wall by a friend (user-generated message) as they are to an official notice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (professional message), but older age groups are less likely to say that they would comply with the user-generated messages. Traditional studies of persuasion, many of which are described in this chapter, typically feature the use of questionnaires and scales that measure changes in attitudes and the perceived persuasiveness of messages. Researchers are beginning to explore the underlying brain processes responsible for these changes (Cacioppo, Cacioppo, & Petty, 2017). Examinations of neural correlates of source factors (such as expertise and celebrity) and message factors (such as positivity/negativity) identify areas of the prefrontal cortex as playing an important role, but many additional structures and networks also participate. Researchers also have begun to explore the neural basis for the effects of persuasive messages on the intention to behave and on actual changes in behavior. Southern Californians were scanned using fMRI (see Chapter 4) while receiving persuasive messages about using sunscreen (Falk, Berkman, Mann, Harrison, & Lieberman, 2010). The researchers identified areas within the prefrontal cortex that predicted participants’ changes in sunscreen use 1 week after the scan. Significant progress has been made in this area, but the problem is extremely complex. Thinking about and acting on a persuasive appeal, as noted in this chapter, combine a number of cognitive and emotional processes. It would be surprising if the underlying neural correlates were simple rather than complex. Some untapped possibilities for pursuing this research question involve studying the aging brain and manipulating brain activity through the use of magnetic stimulation (Cacioppo et al., 2016). The aging brain would enlighten this discussion because the prefrontal cortex undergoes more dramatic change during aging than many other brain structures. Older adults differ in their susceptibility to deceptive advertising and their willingness to change their attitudes in the face of conflicting information. Assessing the differences between these groups and between younger and older participants could be very useful. Magnetic stimulation, which changes the activity of underlying brain structures, could be used to investigate whether particular structures or networks were crucial for a persuasive outcome. While it might take some time to fully grasp the neural correlates of persuasion, efforts in this direction will help us better understand both the process of persuasion itself and the general information processing performed by the brain. Among the most damaging perceptions that we form about other people are those based on their group memberships, which can include factors such as race, gender, age, socioeconomic status, height, weight, disabilities, attractiveness, sexual orientation, and religion. Psychologists use a group of related terms to discuss the assessment of others based on group membership. PrejudicePrejudiceA prejudgment, usually negative, of another person on the basis of membership in a group.            Prejudice        A prejudgment, usually negative, of another person on the basis of membership in a group.            , which literally means to prejudge, is an attitude (usually negative) about others. Prejudice is supported by cognitions known as stereotypesstereotypesA simplified set of traits associated with membership in a group or category            stereotypes        A simplified set of traits associated with membership in a group or category            , which are simplified sets of traits associated with group membership. A person might believe a stereotype that all blondes are dumb, which leads to negative attitudes (prejudice) about blondes. Resulting behavior based on prejudice and stereotyping is considered to be discriminationdiscriminationA learned ability to distinguish between stimuli. (b) Unfair behavior based on stereotyping and prejudice            discrimination        A learned ability to distinguish between stimuli. (b) Unfair behavior based on stereotyping and prejudice            . Hiring practices, housing, educational opportunities, and many other facets of modern living can be conducted in discriminatory ways. Without excusing prejudice and stereotyping and their negative social consequences, it helps to understand that some tendencies to develop prejudice and stereotypes are extensions of the typical ways that we process information. Chapter 10 noted that humans organize information and experience into schemas made up of categories or concepts, which is generally useful. Our concepts are associated with a variety of characteristics, such as Birds have feathers. We frequently have exemplars, or best examples, of each category. If you think of the word bird, you are probably more likely to imagine a canary than an ostrich. Finally, we generalize from our known concepts when faced with new information. If we know that birds peck at objects placed before them, we are less likely to stick our fingers near the beak of a new type of bird. In other words, based on our past experience with or knowledge of birds, we are prejudging the behavior of an unfamiliar bird. This process of categorizing information enables us to make rapid decisions about new situations and objects, similar to the rules of thumb, or heuristics, discussed in Chapter 10. Effective concepts are inclusive, recognizing a full range of associated characteristics. When our categories are oversimplified, we are left with stereotypes. Although it is true that most birds fly, it is inaccurate to oversimplify the matter by just saying Birds fly, because ostriches do not. Stereotypes often contain an element of truth but become inaccurate because of the information that they exclude. More important, stereotypes conflict with our valid desire to be viewed and treated as individuals. If stereotypes can lead us astray, why are they so pervasive and persistent? People tend to misjudge correlations between groups and their stereotypical behaviors. They might overestimate the percentage of Asian students who excel in math and science or underestimate the number of White athletes who play professional basketball. Attributions, discussed earlier, also contribute to continued stereotyping. If you see an exception to your stereotype (perhaps a female who is running faster than her male friend), you might view her success as the result of situational variables. Perhaps the man is letting her win to be nice. This type of thinking allows us to maintain a women are weaker stereotype. People often have negative stereotypes about overweight people as a group. In one online survey, more than 75% of respondents believed that overweight people should either buy a second seat or pay a fat tax to travel on airplanes (Siegfried, 2010). Comedian Kevin Smith, ejected from a Southwest Airlines flight for infringing on a portion of the next seat, tweeted that he broke no regulation, offered no ‘safety risk’ (what, was I going to roll over on a fellow passenger?). You have probably noticed that people’s prejudice toward a group often conflicts with their behaviors toward individual members of that group. Someone might express dramatically prejudiced opinions about a group and yet treat members of that group well. Individuals can be viewed as being different or exceptions, allowing people to retain their stereotypes in the face of conflicting observations. Instead of rethinking a stereotype about truck drivers and country music, you view your truck-driving friend who enjoys opera to be one of a kind. Finally, stereotypes are often maintained by people’s expectations. In one experiment, students listening to a basketball game were informed that a certain player was either Black or White. After the game, students who believed the athlete was Black expressed their stereotypes by rating the player as being highly athletic, while those who believed that the athlete was White praised him for his intelligence and hustle (Stone, Perry, & Darley, 1997). Prejudice, like other types of attitudes, can result from direct experience (I had one boring history professor, so all history professors must be bad), or they can be indirectly absorbed from the social world of peers, parents, the community, and the media. Human prejudice based on group membership, however, might have deeper roots in our evolutionary past. Recognizing and reacting to individuals based on group affiliation was probably an important skill for early hunter–gatherers, whose survival often depended on quickly identifying others as potential trading partners or foes. This pressure could have led to a tendency to distinguish between in-groups, or the group to which we belong, and out-groups, or everybody else (see Figure 13.7). This categorization is made primarily on the basis of physical appearance, and people still instantly (and often unconsciously) categorize others on the basis of physically observable features, including age, gender, and race (Fiske, 1998). Out-groups often elicit mixed reactions. Some out-groups (rich people) are respected for their perceived competence but disliked for their supposed lack of warmth. Elderly people and the disabled are viewed as low in competence, but they are viewed warmly because of the lack of threat that they pose. Groups such as the poor are viewed most harshly as a result of having both low status and representing a threat of exploiting the in-group. This type of categorization was demonstrated by recording brain activity as people viewed photographs of faces and made judgments about either race or gender (Ito & Urland, 2003). Study participants reacted quickly to both race and gender information, even when the information was irrelevant to their task. In other words, a participant who was asked to differentiate between male and female faces still showed evidence of having paid attention to the race of the faces, without being asked to do so. Different emotional responses can accompany these instant categorizations. When study participants viewed faces from their own racial group, activity in the amygdala was lower than when they viewed faces from another racial group (Hart et al., 2000). As discussed in Chapter 4, activity in the amygdala is correlated with assessments of threat. Either realistic or imaginary threats from an out-group are viewed as a major source of prejudice (Stephan & Stephan, 2000). Furthermore, responses of the amygdala to race are correlated with several implicit measures of prejudice (Phelps et al., 2000). Implicit measures are designed to demonstrate subconscious associations between concepts (literature and math, for example) and attitudes (good and bad) (e.g., Nosek, 2007). Psychologists continue to debate the extent to which implicit measures predict actual prejudice (Oswald, Mitchell, Blanton, Jaccard, & Tetlock, 2013). White study participants who showed the greatest differences in amygdala activity while viewing Black and White faces were also more likely to associate positive words such as joy, love, and peace with Whites and negative words such as cancer, bomb, and devil with Blacks. The amygdala activity in response to viewing Black faces might reflect the fear and other negative assessments made by these participants based on racial stereotypes. Oversimplified categories, such as girl toys or boy toys, can lead to stereotypes. Understanding that biological and evolutionary processes are involved with in-group/out-group differentiation does not make prejudice inevitable or acceptable. By understanding why we develop prejudice, we can better identify ways to reduce it. As we will see later in this section, prejudice can change. Prejudice, whether subtle or overt, can lead to discriminatory behavior in a number of ways. Not only are African Americans convicted of murder more likely than Whites to be given the death penalty in the United States, but perceptions of Blackness are also predictive of a murderer being sentenced to death (Eberhardt, Davies, Purdie-Vaughns, & Johnson, 2006). Researchers presented photographs of African-American defendants to participants without telling them that the men depicted had been convicted of murder. The participants ranked the photographs on the basis of stereotypical Black features, such as broad nose, dark skin, and thick lips. The ratings were highly predictive of the men’s sentences when the victim was White. Men who appeared more stereotypically African American were more than twice as likely to be given the death sentence as men whose physical appearance was less stereotypical. This difference disappeared, however, when the victim was also African American (see Figure 13.8). Study participants’ ratings of stereotypical Black features predicted the men’s likelihood of being sentenced for murder with the death penalty, but they did so only when the victim was described as White. The men in these photographs have no criminal records but are examples provided by the authors for individuals who were viewed as less stereotypical (left) and more stereotypical (right). Prejudice affects not only the way we view others, but also the way we view ourselves. Raising awareness of a negative stereotype about a group to which we belong has the ability to reduce our performance, a phenomenon known as stereotype threat (Steele, 1997;  Steele & Aronson, 1995). Anxiety about confirming a negative stereotype attributed to your group can prevent you from doing your best work. In a set of studies demonstrating this effect, researchers asked Stanford University undergraduate students to complete difficult items taken from the verbal portion of the Graduate Record Exam (GRE), used as part of the admissions process for some graduate programs (Steele & Aronson, 1995). One group of students, the stereotype threat group, was told that the test accurately assessed their cognitive abilities, a statement that was designed to stimulate thinking about possible racial stereotypes about intelligence. The other group was told that the test was a routine laboratory procedure. Subsequently, the performance of Black and White students on the test was compared. After controlling for the participants’ previous Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores, the Black students in the stereotype threat group performed more poorly than did the White students. In contrast, in the nonthreatening condition, Blacks and Whites with equal SAT scores performed similarly on the GRE items, which is the result that we would expect because of the tests’ reliability and validity, discussed in Chapter 2 (see Figure 13.9). However, it would be an inaccurate interpretation of Steele and Aronson’s work to suggest that stereotype threat accounts for the bulk of group differences in performance (Stoet & Geary, 2012). Meta-analyses have supported the existence of the stereotype threat effect, but its contribution to overall performance appears to be small to moderate (Spencer,  Logel, & Davies, 2016). Nonetheless, any irrelevant influence on a person’s performance is noteworthy, as these small individual effects can add up to larger influences at the level of entire populations. The Implicit Association Test (IAT) measures reaction time to assess people’s unconscious attitudes. In this version of the test, either a face (African-American or European-American) or a word appears at the center of the screen. The participant pushes a specified key on a computer for the face (African-American) and then again for the word (joy is Good). Later in the test, the combinations at the top of the screen are switched to African-American or Bad and European-American or Good. An implicit bias in favor of African Americans would be shown if reaction time in the first condition (African-American or Good) is faster than in the second condition (African-American or Bad). Students at Stanford University were told that a verbal test measured their true abilities (stereotype threat). After controlling for prior performance on the SAT, the subsequent performance by African-American participants was worse than when they were told that the test was being used to understand the psychological factors involved in solving verbal problems (no stereotype threat). The different instructions did not affect the performance of the White students. Recent news stories have featured a number of tragic and often fatal shootings of unarmed African Americans by police. In many cases, the anger over these cases has boiled over to affect entire communities and the conscience of the nation. What does psychological science tell us about these situations? Research demonstrates a consistent pattern. In computer simulations, White Americans, both real police officers and college undergraduates, are more likely to shoot unarmed African-American than White suspects (Kenworthy, Barden, Diamond, & del Carmen, 2011). In many cases, the researchers explain their results in terms of cultural stereotypes. Stereotypical views of African-American men as more dangerous might shape these quick decisions. To directly assess the role of cultural stereotyping on the decision to shoot, researchers first gave participants a personality test that supposedly gave them a red or green personality (Miller, Zielaskowski, & Plant, 2012). In actuality, participants were randomly assigned to red or green groups. In addition, participants completed a questionnaire assessing how dangerous they thought the world was. Next, the researchers presented faces of White males against a background of either red or green, which the participants were told reflected the personality of the individual. Results showed that no shooter bias occurred when participants were low to moderate in their beliefs about the danger of the world, but a bias did occur among those who saw the world as very dangerous. They were more likely to shoot the faces that were of the other personality color. The researchers performed a second study using White, African-American, and Asian faces. They assumed that there would be no cultural stereotype that Asian males are dangerous. All participants were still more likely to shoot the African-American faces than the White or Asian faces, but participants with high scores on the world is dangerous scale were more likely to shoot Asian faces than White faces. What have we learned from this research? Certainly, these studies confirm that cultural stereotyping is an important source of influence on quick, defensive decisions. In addition, a person’s view of the world as a dangerous place is likely to accentuate a general defensiveness with regard to any out-group member. This research raises concerns about rhetoric among law enforcement personnel likening police work to combat and other factors that heighten a police officer’s sense of being in mortal danger. Viewing our cities as war zones as opposed to communities is likely to produce more, not less, conflict. A video game including individuals holding guns or other objects has been used to examine the effect of race and ethnicity on decisions to shoot. Civilians and police officers both make faster decisions to shoot an armed person if that person is African American and not to shoot an unarmed White target. Although we would prefer a world in which prejudice never occurred, psychologists at least have gained insight into how prejudice can be reduced. Increased contact can reduce prejudice (Skerry, 2000). However, not just any contact will have this effect. To be effective in reducing prejudice, contact must occur under certain circumstances. For example, contact between people of equal standing is more effective in reducing prejudice. If people are from different socioeconomic groups, greater contact may increase rather than decrease between-group resentment. Cooperative learning programs similar to Aronson’s jigsaw classroom are used in most public schools in the United States today. Contact is particularly beneficial in reducing prejudice when groups participate in cooperative activities (see Figure 13.10). In a study using two groups of boys at a summer camp, negative feelings between the groups decreased after the boys cooperated to solve false emergencies, such as interruptions to the camp’s water supply (Sherif, Harvey, White, Hood, & Sherif, 1961). Another classic example of the effectiveness of cooperation in reducing prejudice is the jigsaw classroom, designed to reduce racial tensions in newly desegregated school districts in the 1970s (Aronson, 2011). Children in cooperative groups were assigned a part of the answer that their group needed to learn, leading to interdependence among the group members. Rather than competing for the teacher’s approval, the children in the jigsaw task helped their teammates by listening to and teaching each other. Outcome research indicated that students in jigsaw classrooms mastered the material better, liked their group members better, were absent less frequently, and showed evidence of more empathy and higher self-esteem (Aronson, 2011). This type of cooperative contact is used in deliberate efforts to reduce prejudice in about 80% of elementary schools in the United States (Paluck & Green, 2009). After arbitrarily dividing campers into two groups, the Rattlers and the Eagles, Sherif and his colleagues observed considerable in-group/out-group bias between the groups. During this phase, few of the campers reported having friends from the out-group. To resolve the resulting discord, the researchers set up false emergencies, such as a problem with the camp’s water supply, which required the boys to cooperate. After cooperating, many of their previous biases were no longer present, and more boys reported having friends among the out-group. Because so much prejudice originates in categorizing people and then engaging in in-group/out-group thinking, another strategy for reducing prejudice is to expand the definition of the in-group. For example, if a White female and an Asian female concentrate on the similarities that they share as women, they should experience fewer feelings of bias toward each other on the basis of race (Deschamps & Doise, 1978). Although this effect is not always seen in the laboratory (Vescio, Judd, & Kwan, 2004), when combined with real-world extended contact, the strategy seems to be promising (Eller, Abrams, Viki, & Imara, 2007). Perhaps if we stop focusing on our group identities, we can consider ourselves members of the human race or residents of the planet Earth. If we cooperate to solve problems of hunger, sickness, poverty, and degradation of the environment, the result could be a reduction in prejudice. When acceptance by a group is important to us, we are motivated to behave in ways that increase the likelihood of gaining the group’s approval and avoiding rejection. Groups typically have rules for behavior, known as social normssocial normsUsually unwritten or unspoken rules for behavior in social settings.            social norms        Usually unwritten or unspoken rules for behavior in social settings.            . Social norms can be explicit, or conscious, like wearing shoes into a restaurant; they can also be implicit, or unconscious, like moving to the back of an elevator and turning to face the doors. We often conform to social norms without being asked to do so. In contrast, compliance and obedience lead us to fulfill a request from another person. In compliance, the person making the request has no authority over us, but in obedience, the request is coming from an authority figure. Matching your behavior and appearance to the perceived social norms of a group constitutes conformityconformityMatching behavior and appearance to perceived social norms.            conformity        Matching behavior and appearance to perceived social norms.            . In a classic study of conformity by Solomon Asch (Asch, 1951), participants were asked to match a reference line to one of three comparison lines. As you can see in Figure 13.11, the lines are sufficiently different that solving this task was not rocket science. In the conformity condition, one real participant was placed among a group of confederates (fake participants employed by the investigator). Before the real participant gave an answer, the confederates provided some wrong answers. Would the real participant tell the truth or conform to the answer given by the confederates? In about one third of the trials, the real participants conformed by deliberately choosing a response that they knew was wrong. About three-quarters of the study participants conformed on at least one trial. When a lone participant was asked to match the Exhibit 1 line to Line A, B, or C, the person chose the correct line, A. However, when placed in a group of confederates told to pick another line, people became more likely to go along. Conformity reached its peak in groups of three to four people and did not increase as the group became larger. Conformity to expectations associated with roles was investigated in the Stanford Prison Study (Haney, Banks, & Zimbardo, 1973). In a short time, young men who had been randomly assigned to prisoner or guard roles quickly adopted behaviors consistent with those roles, leading to such inappropriate behavior (violence, etc.) that the study was stopped after only 6 days instead of the planned 14 days. The study has been criticized on the basis of methodological problems due to the active role taken by researcher Philip Zimbardo, who served as the warden in the study and thus influenced how the guards behaved. A similar prison experiment was conducted for BBC television, and this time, few of the guards acted inappropriately (Reicher & Haslam, 2006). In contrast to Zimbardo’s active participation in his own study, the British prison experiment featured little direction from the investigators. However, the likelihood that we unconsciously fulfill the roles expected of us by others remains an active area of scientific investigation. In 2001, Stephen Reicher and Alexander Haslam re-created aspects of the classic Stanford Prison Study, which was conducted by Philip Zimbardo and his colleagues in the 1970s. Zimbardo argued that the roles of guard or prisoner overwhelmed individuality, but Reicher and Haslam believe that the study’s participants were simply responding to Zimbardo’s instructions. Scientists do not always agree with one another, and their debates bring us closer to realistic representations of our world. Why do people conform? Conformity can be useful in ambiguous situations. If you are uncertain about what to do, such as how to dress at work, observing the behavior of others and conforming to it can be helpful. In a computer simulation comparing the effectiveness of social learning strategies, which includes imitation of others, to nonsocial learning strategies, such as trial and error, the social strategies proved far more successful (Rendell et al., 2010). The availability of others to copy might contribute to the overall success of group over independent living. Conformity also reduces the risk of rejection by a social group, a situation that would have greatly threatened the survival of our human ancestors. In a study demonstrating the rejection of nonconformists, participants were asked to debate the fate of an imaginary juvenile delinquent named Johnny Rocco (Schachter, 1951). Three members of the group were confederates. One was instructed to agree with the group consistently, another to disagree with the group consistently, and the third to switch positions from disagreeing to agreeing with the group. When the real participants rated how well they liked other members of the group, members who agreed with the majority were all well liked, and the confederate who changed position was liked best. The participants were unanimous in their intense dislike of the confederate who disagreed with the group. ComplianceComplianceAgreement with a request from a person with no perceived authority            Compliance        Agreement with a request from a person with no perceived authority             occurs when we simply agree to do something because another person asks us to do it, even if that person has no authority over us. From messages in junk mail that tell us to Open immediately. Do not discard and advertising appeals to Buy now to medical instructions that we receive from our dentist or family physician, we are bombarded with requests for compliance. Fulfilling requests from authority figures such as teachers or police officers can provide considerable advantages to society. It is more difficult, however, to explain why people would develop the tendency to comply with requests made by strangers who have no authority. It appears that our natural tendency to affiliate leads us to behave in ways that encourage the development of relationships, including being compliant. Compliance is higher when factors that normally lead to the formation of relationships are present, such as perceived similarity and physical attraction. For example, we are more likely to comply with requests presented by physically attractive people (Lynn & Simons, 2000;  McCall, 1997). This behavior provides yet another example of the Beauty is good stereotype that influences persuasion in general. People are more likely to comply with a request from a person who shares some similarity, even when the similarity is irrelevant, such as a shared birthday (Burger, Messian, Patel, del Prado, & Anderson, 2004). Many seemingly simple yet sophisticated sales techniques exploit our natural tendencies to comply in response to perceiving a social tie with another person (Cialdini & Goldstein, 2004). Once a sense of relationship is established, powerful norms of reciprocation are brought into play. Reciprocation, in which we feel obligated to give something back to people who have given something to us, is one of the most powerful tools of social influence (Gouldner, 1960). The importance of reciprocation to the cohesion of early human groups probably can’t be overestimated. If somebody shared food with you, and you reciprocated by sharing yours, a powerful bond would be formed. Reciprocation has been used to explain compliance in the door-in-the-facedoor-in-the-faceA persuasive technique in which compliance with a target request is preceded by a large, unreasonable request.            door-in-the-face        A persuasive technique in which compliance with a target request is preceded by a large, unreasonable request.             scenario, in which a large, unreasonable demand is followed by a smaller request, which is the one that the requester expects to work (Cialdini et al., 1975). For example, you might be asked to donate a large amount to an organization, followed by a request to give what you can afford. By lowering the initial demand, the salesperson has made a concession. The rules of reciprocation now suggest that you have an obligation to that person and should respond to this concession with one of your own—sending a donation (see Figure 13.12). In a study by  Cialdini et al. (1975), participants in the door-in-the-face condition were first asked to volunteer for 2 hours per week for 2 years as a big brother or big sister at a local juvenile detention center. None agreed. Subsequently, they were asked to spend 2 hours chaperoning a group of delinquents to a local zoo, and 50% agreed. In comparison, only 16.7% of the participants hearing only the zoo request agreed, and 25% of people asked whether they would choose one of the two activities agreed to the zoo request. It is possible that feeling guilty for turning down the first request makes people more likely to agree to a second, smaller request. In addition to reciprocity, the need to appear consistent may drive a considerable amount of compliance. The foot-in-the-doorfoot-in-the-doorA persuasive technique in which compliance with a small request is followed by compliance with a larger request that might otherwise have been rejected.            foot-in-the-door        A persuasive technique in which compliance with a small request is followed by compliance with a larger request that might otherwise have been rejected.             technique, in which a small request is followed up by a larger request, is especially effective in gaining compliance. Liking an organization on Facebook (a small request) can lead to more purchases and brand loyalty (larger requests). Another technique based on the need to appear consistent is the low-ballinglow-ballingMaking further requests of a person who has already committed to a course of action.            low-balling        Making further requests of a person who has already committed to a course of action.             strategy, in which an initially favorable deal is revised upward once the buyer appears committed (Cialdini, Cacioppo, Bassett, & Miller, 1978). Once you have made a commitment to buy a car, the salesperson leaves to check the deal with a supervisor and invariably returns with a few more charges to make the deal work. The salesperson is counting on you to agree to the higher price because you have already made a public commitment to buy the car. If you stand up at this point and prepare to leave, it is likely that those extra charges will quickly disappear. According to the foot-in-the-door technique, agreeing with a small request, such as clicking the Like button on Facebook, makes it more likely that you will agree with larger requests, such as buying products from a company. ObedienceObedienceCompliance with a request from an authority figure            Obedience        Compliance with a request from an authority figure             is defined as compliance with the request of an authority figure. When you take an exam from a professor or show your driver’s license to a police officer, you are being obedient. The power of authorities to gain obedience is probably due to our perception of their legitimacy. Men dressed in normal attire had less influence than men dressed as security guards when making simple requests of passersby, even though the requests (Pick up that bag or Give that man a dime for the parking meter) had nothing to do with their perceived roles (Bickman, 1974). In a series of classic experiments, Stanley Milgram attempted to demonstrate the power of authority over personal ethics (Milgram, 1974). Milgram’s participants entered his laboratory at Yale University believing that they were to take part in a study of the effects of punishment on learning. The other participant present was a confederate, and the situation was rigged so that the real participant would take the role of teacher while the confederate took the role of learner. The punishment for failing to learn pairs of words was an electric shock, to be administered by the teacher to the learner using an intimidating piece of equipment. The learner or confederate received no actual shocks; his verbal responses to shocks were prerecorded. In most cases, Milgram’s experiment began uneventfully. However, the first challenge to the teacher occurred at 75 volts, at which time the learner’s first recorded protest could be heard. When faced with this situation, many of Milgram’s participants looked to the experimenter in the room for guidance. The experimenter assured the participant that the experiment must continue and you have no choice. Although most participants showed signs of stress and verbally stated their concerns about the procedure, all of Milgram’s original 40 participants went as far as 300 volts, and 26 out of the 40 (65%) fully complied by administering the maximum shock (450 volts). Milgram followed up his original scenario by modifying variables that might have influenced the large number of people willing to obey. No differences in outcome were observed when the experiment was conducted in an off-campus office or with participants of different ages and occupations. Among the variables that did seem to influence Milgram’s results was proximity, both between the teacher and the learner and between the teacher and the experimenter. The proximity between the teacher and the learner ranged from complete separation, in which the two people could neither see nor hear each other, to closeness, in which the teacher was instructed to physically hold the learner’s hand on a shock grid. As proximity between the teacher and the learner increased, rates of obedience dropped to about 30% (see Figure 13.13). After his initial study, in which the teacher could hear but not see the learner, Milgram varied the experimental circumstances to see what variables influenced the amount of obedience that his participants displayed. The teacher, learner together condition took place with both people in the same room. In the teacher touches learner condition, the teacher had to hold the learner’s hand down on a shock device. As the teacher and learner came into more contact, obedience dropped, but it remained surprisingly high overall. The implications of this result for modern war technologies are clear. People are more likely to operate a drone that harms a person whom they can neither see nor hear than they are to harm a person whose pain is apparent. The proximity of the teacher and the experimenter also was quite influential. The experimenter communicated with the teacher while in the room, by telephone, or by tape recording. Obedience dropped dramatically as interaction with the experimenter, who represented authority, became more remote. Obedience varies across cultures, but no one is immune. Milgram’s data suggest that about 65% of the American population, with equal numbers of men and women, would fully comply in his basic experiment (Milgram, 1963). The highest rates of obedience are found in the general public of the Netherlands (92%;  Meeus & Raaijmakers, 1995), Austria (80%; Schurz, 1985), and Germany (85%; Mantell, 1971). Australia reports some of the lowest levels of obedience, along with one of the few notable gender differences reported in the obedience literature—40% of Australian male students were fully obedient, but only 16% of Australian female students were fully obedient (Kilham & Mann, 1974). Milgram’s original goal was to illuminate some of the most troubling behavior of modern times, particularly the killing of millions of innocent people in the Holocaust, so it is no surprise that his results are among the most disturbing in modern psychology. Milgram clearly demonstrated that typical people are willing to harm others under the right sets of circumstances. But did he meet his goal of modeling Nazi obedience? He believed so. You may be more comfortable thinking that people who could carry out genocide are different from the students sitting next to you in class. But Milgram’s findings suggest otherwise:Ordinary people, simply doing their jobs, and without any particular hostility on their part, can become agents in a terrible destructive process. Moreover, even when the destructive effects of their work become patently clear, and they are asked to carry out actions incompatible with fundamental standards of morality, relatively few people have the resources needed to resist authority. (Milgram, 1974, p. 6)You might be thinking optimistically that people today are different from Milgram’s participants in the 1960s. Between the 1920s and the 1980s, parents in the United States shifted their preferences for their children’s outcomes from obedience to autonomy (Alwin, 1988). We can begin to evaluate the impact of this parenting change because Milgram’s experiment has been partially replicated fairly recently by Burger (Burger, 2009). By partially replicated, we mean that Burger made procedural changes for the purposes of meeting ethical requirements, such as informing participants that they could leave if they felt uncomfortable. Despite these changes, Burger’s results were similar to Milgram’s (82.5% of Milgram’s participants obeyed under the same circumstances in which 66.7% of Burger’s male participants obeyed). Burger’s participants were told explicitly that they could leave at any time, which raises questions about previous explanations of Milgram’s results in terms of coercion (Griggs, 2017). An alternative view of the reasons behind the behavior of Milgram’s participants suggests that something called engaged followership is more important than coercion (Haslam, Reicher, Millard, & McDonald, 2015). In engaged followership, people are willing to do unpleasant things, so long as they agree with the objectives. Leaders, like Milgram’s experimenter, promote followers’ identification with their objectives, which makes even the most unpleasant tasks seem virtuous. This in turn reduces the stress experienced by the followers. This model seems to present a clearer picture of Milgram’s participants, the Nazis that he wanted to understand, and fanatic followers of many types. If you believe in your cause, there aren’t too many things you wouldn’t do to reach your goals. No society can exist without obedience. However, history is full of instances in which blindly following orders leads people into highly unethical behavior. Even in more commonplace situations, obedience to authority can overwhelm individual judgment. In one chilling obedience experiment, 22 nurses were telephoned by a doctor they didn’t know and instructed to administer a drug not listed on a patient’s chart in double its normal dose (Hofling, Brotzman, Dalrymple, Graves, & Pierce, 1966). Astonishingly, 21 of the 22 nurses indicated that they would be willing to obey the order. We could argue that it is desirable for nurses to carry out the directions of physicians, but at what point do we want people to question authority? Our discussion of conformity, compliance, and obedience would be incomplete without considering the circumstances in which an individual or small group can influence a larger group. Asch provided a clue to the necessary conditions when he noted that conformity was greatest when a person faced a unanimous group. A single individual’s willingness to take an opposing view may encourage others to also resist the pressure to conform to a misguided action, or at least to reconsider their original position. To successfully influence the majority, a minority voice must display consistency and confidence. In a study designed to determine the factors that enabled a minority to influence a majority, people occasionally agreed with an individual who consistently stated that blue slides were green, but never agreed with an individual who judged blue to be green only part of the time (Moscovici, Lage, & Naffrechoux, 1969). Individual voices that are raised confidently, as in the case of Mahatma Gandhi or Martin Luther King, Jr., are more likely to influence the majority than are more tentative efforts. The anonymous Tank Man of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in Beijing, China, created a minutes-long standoff by maintaining his position in front of a column of tanks. Single individuals disagreeing with a majority with confidence and consistency can stimulate others to reconsider their positions. We do not know the fate of Tank Man today. We have explored many instances in which situations seem to have a large impact on people’s behavior. Given the sociability of our species, it should not be surprising to learn that one of the most powerful situational influences on our behavior is the presence of other people. How is our behavior different when we are with others compared to when we are alone? Social facilitationSocial facilitationA situation in which the presence of other people changes performance            Social facilitation        A situation in which the presence of other people changes performance             occurs when the presence of other people changes individual performance. In 1898, Norman Triplett reported that cyclists riding in pairs rode faster than cyclists riding alone. Social facilitation is not limited to cycling. Children spinning fishing reels did so faster when in groups than when they were alone. Because of social facilitation, a well-practiced skill (like pedaling by these professional cyclists) is enhanced by the presence of others. In contrast to Triplett’s observations, we have all seen skilled performers choke in front of an important audience. Why does performance improve in front of audiences in some situations and become worse in others? Psychologists noticed that well-practiced skills, like riding a bicycle, improved with an audience, but that when people were still learning a new skill, they performed badly (Zajonc, 1968;  Zajonc & Sales, 1966). When we’re performing a well-practiced skill, most of what we do is correct, but when we are learning something new, most of the things we do are wrong. The presence of the audience appears to enhance whichever patterns of behavior are dominant—the right moves in a well-practiced skill and the wrong moves in a new skill. The moral of this story is to make sure that you practice thoroughly before you perform in front of an audience. The complexity of a task also can interact with the presence of an audience to produce either improved or impaired performance (Bond & Titus, 1983). This result implies that one of the functions of the audience is to increase the performer’s level of arousal. The Yerkes–Dodson law, discussed in Chapter 7, states that performance on simple tasks improves steadily with arousal, but that performance on complex tasks first improves and then becomes impaired as arousal continues to grow (Yerkes & Dodson, 1908). Improvements in performance are more likely to occur when people are engaged in simple, well-practiced activities, such as riding a bicycle, as opposed to highly complex, novel activities, such as memorizing a difficult list of words. While working on group projects, you have probably had opportunities to observe social loafingsocial loafingReduced motivation and effort shown by individuals working in a group.            social loafing        Reduced motivation and effort shown by individuals working in a group.            , or the reduced motivation and effort shown by individuals working in a group as opposed to working alone. When engaged in a tug-of-war game at a picnic, members of a team exert less individual effort with each additional person added to their side (Kravitz & Martin, 1986). Individuals cheer less loudly in a large group than they do in a smaller group (Latané, Williams, & Harkins, 1979). Because of social loafing, we would expect the cheering by each of these fans in a nearly empty stadium to be louder than the cheering produced by individual fans in a packed stadium. Individual, gender, cultural, and task variables interact to produce social loafing. Women are somewhat less likely to demonstrate social loafing than men, and people from Eastern cultures are less likely to loaf than those from the West (Karau & Williams, 1993). Simple physical tasks, such as screwing and unscrewing nuts and bolts, reliably produce social loafing in most people (Petty, Cacioppo, & Kasmer, 1988). Task complexity interacts with a need for cognition, or the motivation to engage in and enjoy effortful cognitive endeavors (Cacioppo, Petty, & Kao, 1984). People with a low need for cognition showed social loafing during both a physical task and a brainstorming task in which they were asked to generate a list of possible uses for an object (Cacioppo, Petty, Feinstein, & Jarvis, 1996). In contrast, individuals who demonstrate a high need for cognition take pleasure in difficult mental tasks, and although they showed social loafing on the simple physical task, they did not socially loaf during the more intellectually demanding brainstorming task. Individuals appear less likely to take the opportunity to socially loaf on tasks that they find intrinsically enjoyable to perform. If you participate in online discussions, you might notice a difference in the way that people relate on platforms such as Facebook compared to the anonymous platforms in some message boards and chat rooms. Deindividuation predicts that anonymous message boards would feature less inhibition, such as less civil discussion, than would platforms where individual identity is obvious. DeindividuationDeindividuationImmersion of an individual within a group, leading to anonymity            Deindividuation        Immersion of an individual within a group, leading to anonymity             refers to the immersion of the individual within a group, which makes the individual relatively anonymous. Deindividuation can lead normally law-abiding people to commit uncharacteristic atrocities, including riots and lynchings. Why would people go along with the negative behavior of a surrounding group, especially if they are unlikely to behave this way on their own? One possibility is that anonymous people feel less accountable for their actions. In an experiment using a paradigm similar to Milgram’s obedience experiments described earlier, participants dressed in hoods and oversized lab coats administered longer shocks than control participants who were dressed in normal clothing with name tags (Zimbardo, 1969). Other psychologists suggest that you do not necessarily lose yourself in a group, but that your attention shifts from a personal identity to the identity of the surrounding group (Lea & Spears, 1991). If that surrounding group begins to act in antisocial ways, the personal controls normally present within you might not be enough to resist going along. Common sense suggests that discussion with others who express different opinions should produce more moderate attitudes for everyone in the group. Surprisingly, this is not always the case. In group polarizationgroup polarizationThe intensifying of an attitude following discussion            group polarization        The intensifying of an attitude following discussion            , a period of discussion pushes group members to take more extreme positions in the direction that they were already inclined to prefer (Moscovici & Zavalloni, 1969). Group polarization does not reverse the direction of attitudes, but rather accentuates the attitudes held at the outset (see Figure 13.14). If group members began mildly favoring gun control, their attitudes will be more favorable after discussion, whereas if group members began with a mildly unfavorable position on gun control, their attitudes will be more unfavorable after discussion. We like to think that we can come together and talk out our differences, but that does not always happen. Discussion often moves individuals to take more extreme versions of their original positions. After individually rating French leader Charles de Gaulle and Americans in general (both of which were rated somewhat positively), groups of four French college students were asked to reach consensus on the ratings and then provide a second set of individual ratings. Following the group discussion leading to consensual ratings, the students’ individual ratings were more extreme (more positive, in this example) than their first ratings had been. Two pressures appear to push individuals to take more extreme positions following a group discussion. First, conformity and desire for affiliation contribute to group polarization. If the majority of a group is leaning in a particular direction, what could be a better way of fitting in than agreeing with that majority, and maybe even taking its argument one step farther? There is also a tendency for like-minded people to affiliate with one another, which can provide reinforcement for existing opinions, increase people’s confidence in those opinions, lead to the discovery of new reasons for those opinions and counterarguments to opposing views, and reduce exposure to conflicting ideas. Second, exposure to discussion on a topic introduces new reasons for holding an attitude. If you are already opposed to gun control and you listen to additional arguments supporting your position, you might end up more opposed than you were originally. Group polarization is frequently studied in the context of the behaviors of juries. Following deliberations, final sentencing decisions by mock juries are typically more severe or more lenient than the original opinions expressed by individual group members (Bray & Noble, 1978). Group polarization appears to be even more powerful in online discussions, where people are exposed to many more arguments on issues than they might generate on their own (Himelboim, McCreery, & Smith, 2013;  Sia, Tan, & Wei, 2002). Deindividuation, or the loss of personal identity within a crowd, can lead people to do things that they would not do on their own. As we discovered in our discussion of conformity, the presence of others can influence the process of decision making. In Asch’s experiments, individuals appeared to make a choice in favor of group harmony over accuracy. If group members suppress dissenting opinions in the interests of group cohesion, the group may fall into a state of groupthinkgroupthinkA type of flawed decision making in which a group does not question its decisions critically            groupthink        A type of flawed decision making in which a group does not question its decisions critically            . This type of flawed decision making might account for a number of unfortunate group decisions throughout history (Janis, 1972). Among the examples most frequently described as results of groupthink are the Bay of Pigs invasion, the Korean and Vietnam Wars, and the Cuban missile crisis (Rose, 2011). These examples are notable because of their disastrous results, but they may not be representative of groupthink outcomes. For example, many terrorist organizations meet the criteria stipulated by  Janis (1972) for groupthink, and yet they have arguably met a number of their short-term objectives, including the terrorist attacks of 9/11 (Rose, 2011). Smart, experienced groups of people can make some not-so-smart decisions because of groupthink. In 2001, Yahoo! had the opportunity to buy a company called Google, started by Stanford University graduates Sergey Brin (left) and Larry Page (right). The Yahoo! executives hesitated, and the opportunity passed—a decision that they probably regret today. Groupthink is especially likely in cohesive groups with high morale whose members already share similar attitudes (Baron, 2005). Members of cohesive groups are less likely to consider risks or alternatives associated with their chosen plan of action. In many cases, the group is far from unanimous, but individuals are unwilling to step forward in dissent, just as many of Asch’s participants preferred to go along rather than rock the boat. This illusion of a unanimous group further stifles serious consideration of alternatives before making a decision. Part of our heritage as a social species involves the need not only to affiliate with a group, but also to form important social relationships with individual people. These relationships can be between family members, peers, coworkers, neighbors, or romantic partners. Psychologists have discovered a number of underlying themes that affect this important part of life. Attraction refers to our attitudes about other people and can vary along a continuum from strong liking to strong disliking. It varies in quality and strength, which in turn helps to determine the type of relationship that we form with another person. We are attracted to our romantic partners in stronger and more physical ways than we are attracted to our friends and acquaintances. We know what attraction to another person feels like, but it is more difficult to identify the variables that predict our attraction to a particular person. Before you can be attracted to a person, you need to have some contact with that person. Contact becomes more likely when people work, live, or spend leisure time in proximity to one another. In an early exploration of this concept, 5,000 marriage licenses in which one or both partners lived in Philadelphia were examined (Bossard, 1932). In about one third of the marriages, the partners had lived five blocks or less from each other before marrying. As distance between homes increased, the number of couples decreased. In the contemporary era of online dating, proximity can take forms other than physical closeness. Musicians recognize the advantages of the mere exposure effect. Hearing a song frequently makes it more likeable. Placement of a song in a television show or movie is virtually guaranteed to boost sales of the artist’s work. Proximity is important to relationships because simple contact can increase liking. In contrast to the proverb Familiarity breeds contempt, regular exposure to neutral or positive stimuli generally leads to increased liking, a principle known as the mere exposure effectmere exposure effectA situation in which repeated exposure increases liking            mere exposure effect        A situation in which repeated exposure increases liking             (see Figure 13.15). In one example of this effect, people who repeatedly viewed nonsense words described as Turkish words and Chinese-like symbols reported liking them better than those that they were seeing for the first time (Zajonc, 1968). The mere exposure effect applies to people too (Swap, 1977). From an evolutionary point of view, the mere exposure effect might have led people to avoid unfamiliar, and possibly dangerous, stimuli (Young & Claypool, 2010). Unfortunately, having an inclination to make more negative responses to unfamiliar people also might contribute to prejudice. More frequent exposure to these nonsense Turkish adjectives resulted in higher ratings among American college students on their goodness of meaning. To what extent do similarities and differences influence our friendships and romantic relationships? In one experiment, college students read the results of an attitude survey supposedly filled out by another student (Byrne, 1961). As the attitudes expressed became closer to the students’ attitudes, the students reported that the anonymous person was better liked, more intelligent, and better informed about current events. Apparently, assuming that we like ourselves, we find it easy to like people with whom we are similar. People tend to choose friends and romantic partners who are similar in race, ethnicity, religion, values, education, and age (Buss, 1985;  Kandel, 1978). However, the number of interracial couples in the United States has grown dramatically since 1960 (Joyner & Kao, 2005;  Lee, 2010). Although people may be initially attracted to those with whom they share similar characteristics, being attracted to another person also increases similarity, a process known as attitude alignment. Attitudes of dating partners grow closer together in a gradual process (Davis & Rusbult, 2001). At the same time, partners in stable relationships often overestimate the similarity of their attitudes (Murray, Holmes, Gellavia, Griffin, & Dolderman, 2002). Most long-term couples share an approximately equal level of attractiveness and may even have similar features or physique, as do Sting and Trudie Styler. Physical appearance is a dominant factor in romantic attraction. After completing questionnaires assessing personality and academic achievement, study participants were randomly paired for a computer dance. Male participants were subsequently asked whether they would ask their partner for a second date. The only significant variable out of all the personality and other data collected that predicted the likelihood of a second date was the woman’s physical attractiveness (Walster, Aronson, & Abrahams, 1966). Cultures frequently have their own definitions of physical beauty, but we appear to have some underlying, biological preferences. Beauty serves as a marker for health and fertility. By choosing a beautiful mate, you may be enhancing your abilities to produce healthy children with a strong chance of survival. Preferences for faces rated as beautiful by adults can be demonstrated in infants as young as 3 months of age (Langlois, Roggman, & Rieser-Danner, 1990). Subjective judgments of beauty are heavily influenced by symmetry, or the degree of similarity between one half of the body or face and the other half. Symmetrical bodies are more likely to be healthy, so they are highly sought in prospective mates (Thornhill & Gangestad, 1994). As further evidence of the importance of symmetry in mate choice, symmetry of faces was more important to heterosexual research participants in opposite-sex judgments of attractiveness than in same-sex judgments of attractiveness (Little, Jones, DeBruine, & Feinberg, 2008). People show strong preferences for symmetrical faces (bottom row) compared to the less symmetrical versions of the same faces (top row). Symmetry may serve as an outward sign of genetic health. Most romantic couples share a common level of physical attractiveness, a concept known as the matching hypothesis. Couples who were most similar in terms of physical attractiveness were more likely to be together 9 months later (White, 1980). However, when longer-lasting heterosexual relationships are examined, female partners tend to be rated as slightly more attractive than their male partners (McNulty, Neff, & Karney, 2008). Self-disclosure, or sharing personal information about yourself, follows a regular progression as people become more intimate with one another (Taylor & Altman, 1987). Acquaintances talk about general topics other than themselves. New friends might discuss their personal abilities and attitudes, whereas close friends move on to consider dreams and goals. Intimate friends might share fears and negative past behaviors. Intimacy is highest when falling in love, but what does love look like under the microscope? Robert Sternberg’s triangular model of love distinguishes the building of different types of relationships along dimensions of intimacy, passion, and commitment (Sternberg, 2004). Intimacy refers to the closeness or bonding that we experience with another person, passion includes sexual attraction and romance, and commitment describes the intent to maintain the relationship over time. Intimacy without passion or commitment is characteristic of most friendships. Passion by itself characterizes an infatuation, or love at first sight. Commitment alone could describe the situation in which a person remains loyal to a partner whose health makes intimacy and passion no longer possible, as in the case of a partner with dementia (see Figure 13.16). According to Sternberg, close relationships vary along the dimensions of intimacy, passion, and commitment. Consummate love combines all three. Combinations of intimacy and passion define romantic love. Without the addition of commitment, this type of love can fade quickly. Intimacy and commitment occur together as companionate love. This love exists without passion in deep friendships, family relationships, and long-term partnerships in which sexuality no longer plays a significant role. A combination of passion and commitment can occur in an impulsive whirlwind relationship, in which insufficient time has elapsed for the development of true intimacy. Finally, people who are lucky enough to find all three components in the same relationship experience consummate love.

PassionConsummate loveIntimacy + commitment + passionNothingWhat factors keep people together? Some strategies seem particularly important to many types of relationships, including friendships, family relationships, and romantic relationships. People continue to use openness and self-disclosure as relationships mature, along with participation in joint activities, provision of reassurance, and communication (Berscheid, 2004;  Canary, Stafford, Hause, & Wallace, 1993). Research by Gottman and Gottman (Gottman & Gottman, 2017) describe how turning toward a bid for attention offered by a partner rather than turning away or against is predictive of happier relationships. For example, one person might bid for a response from a partner by commenting on something of personal interest, such as Look at that beautiful dog! The partner can turn toward the bid (Yes, I agree. That’s a really pretty dog, but our dog is even prettier!), away from the bid (ignoring it), or against the bid (Don’t bother me now. I’m reading!). The researchers found that couples divorced after six years of marriage turned toward bids only 33% of the time, compared to 86% of the time for couples still married. In research by Gottman and Gottman (2017), successful couples are much more likely to turn toward a bid made by a partner, such as interest in the Super Bowl. Less successful couples are more likely to turn away from (don’t bother me) or against (I hate football) a partner’s bid. Maintaining a relationship may become easier over time. As couples spend more time together, they build a shared history, which provides them with a stronger basis for understanding each other. Couples who have been together for many years appear to have the ability to communicate a thought or emotion to each other with a single look (Schober & Carstensen, 2010). Long-term relationships can become boring, however. Couples who continue to engage in novel and exciting activities have higher relationship satisfaction (Aron, Norman, Aron, McKenna, & Heyman, 2000). As you are no doubt well aware, real life does not typically follow the scripts of fairy tales, in which the lovers ride off into the sunset to live happily ever after. Maintaining relationships takes time and effort, and sometimes people are wrong for one another. A sense of inequity or unfairness in a relationship may cause it to end. Equity in a relationship suggests that costs, such as curtailed freedom and less time to oneself, are offset by benefits, such as companionship and security. In general, more equitable romantic relationships are stable, enjoyable, and sexually intimate. Most couples experience their share of ups and downs, but the relative number of their positive and negative experiences is related to the likelihood that the relationship will survive or end (Gottman, Swanson, & Swanson, 2002). Couples appear to need about five positive interactions to offset one negative interaction. As the ratio of positive to negative interactions slips toward 1:1, the likelihood that the relationship will end increases. Couples with high levels of apparent conflict might still stay together, so long as their conflict is offset by a larger amount of positive times together. Infidelity often contributes to the ending of a romantic relationship. Data describing how frequently romantic partners cheat on each other are difficult to obtain and show wide variations, as in the 33%–75% of men and 26%–70% of women reported to cheat on their partners in one review of the literature (Buss & Schmitt, 1993). Men and women also appear to respond to different aspects of cheating behavior (see Figure 13.17). Males become jealous of sexual infidelity, whereas females are more distressed by emotional infidelity (Buss, Larsen, & Westen, 1992). In other words, a woman would be less distressed if her partner had a one-night stand while drunk than if he had an ongoing relationship with a mistress whom he supported financially. In any case, relationship jealousy can have dangerous implications. More than one-third of female homicides worldwide are committed by intimate partners (Stöckl et al., 2013). When asked which would cause greater distress, your partner cheating on you sexually or becoming deeply emotionally involved with a rival, men reported greater distress from sexual infidelity, whereas women reported greater distress from emotional infidelity. Our social interactions with one another can feature cooperation, or working together toward common goals, or competition, where we struggle with one another to obtain limited resources. Both cooperation and competition have a long history in shaping our behavior. In Chapter 3, we described natural selection as an ongoing race among organisms competing for scarce resources and opportunities to reproduce (Darwin, 1859). The stakes in this race are high. Individuals with characteristics that give them an advantage over others are able to pass their genes along, while losers fail to reproduce and die. At the same time, because humans do not live alone, our survival depends on cooperation. Individual animals frequently compete for food or opportunities to mate. Beginning with observations of pecking order among chickens (Schjedlderup-Ebbe, 1975), biologists have cataloged many species that use competition, usually in the form of fighting, to determine the allocation of mating opportunities, food, and other resources both within and between groups. The advantages of cooperation can be illustrated by a real-life tale of two 1864 shipwrecks in the South Pacific. Members of one crew worked cooperatively with one another as equals, while members of the other maintained their formal command structure. After 1 year, the first crew managed to build a boat and get rescued, while the second was decimated by cold, hunger, and cannibalism (Druett, 2007). Too much competition among individual members hampers the cohesion of a group, breaking it into factions and possibly resulting in injuries among its members. Consequently, many animals minimize the extent of within-group conflict by displaying clear signals of dominance, or high status. The mandrill, a type of baboon, uses facial expressions and gestures to signify its position in a dominance hierarchy. The coloring of the mandrill’s face, rump, and genitalia is also reflective of individual fighting abilities (Setchell & Wickings, 2005). Do humans have analogous signals of dominance? It appears that the male of the species does (Mazur & Mueller, 1996). Dominant human male faces are handsome and muscular, featuring strong chins, deep-set eyes, and prominent brows. In contrast, baby-faced males are rated by observers as being more submissive (McArthur & Berry, 1987). Humans have the advantage of augmenting their natural signals of status by purchasing and displaying expensive automobiles, homes, and jewelry. Animals minimize the damage caused by competing for dominance by displaying clear signals of submission. The dog on its back is letting the other dog know that its dominance has been recognized. Individuals vary in their predisposition to cooperation or competition. In one experiment, groups of participants were given the opportunity to compete (by keeping tokens) or cooperate (by sharing tokens) while they observed the decisions made by their group members (Kurzban & Houser, 2005). Three types of dispositions emerged: 17% of the participants were cooperators, who gave their tokens freely without paying much attention to the behavior of other group members; 20% were free riders, who didn’t give up any of their tokens; and 63% of the participants were reciprocators, who cooperated only after seeing others do so. Even though cooperators are in the minority, their behavior is important to group survival. By contributing selflessly, they encourage the majority of the group to cooperate too. Members of successful groups are more likely to survive and reproduce than members of unsuccessful groups. Because it is in our best interest to belong to effective groups, we cooperate with other group members and are quick to conform to their norms and judgments. Cooperation becomes ingrained in the group’s culture and is passed along to new members. Why is cooperation so essential to successful group behavior? Without cooperation, there would be no basis for gathering diverse areas of individual expertise into a meaningful, useful whole. Under the influence of culture, humans have progressed from simple divisions of labor to highly specialized areas of expertise. Individuals might spend their entire academic careers exploring the structure of the frog retina or the surface characteristics of one of Saturn’s moons. At the same time, no single person working alone would be able to put humans on the Moon or produce all the special effects expected by contemporary movie audiences. Few fans would pay to see an individual football player demonstrate his skills on an otherwise empty field on Sunday afternoon. Cooperation is the glue that holds productive groups together, from the operating room of a hospital to the baseball diamond. The importance of group membership to survival is reflected in the remarkable loyalty that humans show to their culturally defined groups. Fans of a particular sports team may be every bit as loyal to their group (and as potentially violent toward others) as our early hunter–gatherer ancestors were to their tribe or clan. Unfortunately, the same loyalty and cultural distinctiveness that bind us to our groups may lead us into conflict with other groups, as discussed later in this chapter. Cooperation is essential to successful group behavior. How do people decide when to compete and when to cooperate? A classic model of competition and cooperation within groups is known as the prisoner’s dilemma (Poundstone, 1992). Assume that you and another person have been arrested for a crime, but that the police have limited evidence against you. Without being able to communicate with your partner, you are given the choice to confess (defect from your partner) or to remain silent (cooperate with your partner). If you both remain silent, you will each be sentenced to 1 year. If you both confess, you will each receive 10 years. However, if one confesses and the other remains silent, the prisoner who confesses will be set free, and the silent prisoner will receive a 20-year sentence. The dilemma arises because the best individual strategy is to confess or defect from your partner, but if both of you figure this out and subsequently confess, your outcome is worse than if you both had remained silent (see Figure 13.18). In the prisoner’s dilemma, cooperation is moderately rewarded (a 1-year sentence), while defection is punished (10 years). If only one of you confesses, however, the confessor is highly rewarded (freedom), while the other person is severely punished (20 years). For real people, computers, and even animals, the most successful strategy in the prisoner’s dilemma situation is the tit-for-tat (TFT) strategy (Axelrod & Hamilton, 1981). Using the TFT strategy, you make cooperation your first move and then repeat your partner’s successive moves. The success of the TFT strategy has been attributed to three aspects: It is nice (you begin with cooperation), it is able to retaliate and punish uncooperative behavior (defection by your partner is followed by your own defection), and it is forgiving (you return immediately to cooperation following cooperation on the part of your partner (Brembs, 1996). The research on individual differences in cooperation discussed earlier found that most human participants were reciprocators, whose behavior is most similar to the TFT strategy (Kurzban & Houser, 2005). The prevalence of this type might reflect its typical success. If most people are reciprocators, how can we explain the existence of the other types? Free riders clearly benefit from their selfish behavior, but what advantages might increase the chances of the cooperators’ survival and reproductive success? It is easier to be generous when you are well off, so acting like a cooperator might make people believe that you have extensive resources, improving your chances of attracting a mate (Milinski, Semmann, & Jrambeck, 2002). A person’s reputation is also a powerful motivator for cooperation. In ongoing prisoner’s dilemma games, participants use other people’s record of cooperation (or lack thereof) to determine whether to cooperate with them (Milinski et al., 2002). In small hunter–gatherer bands or basketball teams, having a reputation for selfishness is not likely to make you successful. Culture can shape a person’s choice of competition and cooperation. When two people from different countries played the prisoner’s dilemma game, less cooperation and more competition occurred than when two people from the same country participated together (Matsumoto & Hwang, 2011). Furthermore, the bigger the difference between the native countries of the participants along the dimension of individualism or collectivism, the less cooperation occurred. This finding reflects the in-group bias mentioned earlier in the chapter. Contributing to our cooperative abilities is a deep-seated, possibly biological sense of fair play that is shared with other species in the animal kingdom. Capuchin monkeys will happily trade pebbles for slices of cucumber until they see another monkey receiving the more preferred grapes for its pebbles. After seeing the unfairness of their situation, they are no longer willing to work for cucumber slices (Brosnan & De Waal, 2003). When people playing a prisoner’s dilemma game were observed with fMRI, viewing the faces of cooperators produced activation in brain areas normally linked to reward (T.  Singer, Kiebel, Winston, Dolan, & Frith, 2004). In contrast, when people were treated unfairly, activation occurred in parts of the brain associated with anger, disgust, and pain (Sanfey, Rilling, Aronson, Nystrom, & Cohen, 2003). A capuchin monkey refuses to exchange a pebble for a slice of cucumber after seeing another monkey receive a more highly valued grape for its pebble, suggesting that nonhuman primates have a sense of fairness. We have all read stories about soldiers, firefighters, and others who have risked or even sacrificed their lives to save the lives of others. These instances are examples of altruism, a helping behavior that either fails to reward or actually harms the person who performs it, which was discussed in Chapter 3. Instances of altruism in which the helper is exposed to risk or experiences harm are often described as heroism (Franco, Blau, & Zimbardo, 2011). The designation of hero is often given to people who are altruistic to the point of risking their lives to help others. In 2007, Wesley Autrey (shown here with his daughter) selflessly risked his life to save a young man who fell onto New York subway tracks after suffering a seizure. If behavior usually leads to improved survival and reproduction, how can we account for altruism? Charles Darwin suggested that [a] tribe including many members who were always ready to give aid to each other and sacrifice themselves for the common good, would be victorious over most other tribes; and this would be natural selection (Darwin, 1871, p. 166). Although this suggestion is attractive, it suffers from a major flaw in logic. The system suggested by Darwin would produce free riders who were not altruistic themselves, but who would benefit from the altruistic behaviors of the members of their group (Dawkins, 1976). These individuals, because they would undoubtedly live to reproduce (as opposed to the altruistic, who might not survive), should eventually swamp the group with selfish genes. Several evolutionary mechanisms have been proposed that account for the continuation of cooperative, altruistic behavior (Nowak, 2006). Although altruistic behaviors may have costs for an individual, they may benefit the altruist’s genetic relatives. Altruistic genes will survive in the population so long as the cost to an altruist is associated with a large-enough benefit to relatives (Hamilton, 1964). Japanese macaque monkeys are more likely to defend close relatives from attack than they are to defend unrelated monkeys (Kurland, 1977). People are more likely to help their relatives than they are strangers, such as in helping to raise their children. Altruism is also maintained by expectations that a favor might someday be returned by those you have helped, a process known as reciprocal altruism (Trivers, 1971). Vampire bats often regurgitate blood to share with bats who did not hunt successfully; bats are more likely to share with those who had shared with them recently (Wilkinson, 1984,  1990). Selfishness might be limited by punishment administered by other group members. Study participants who had the opportunity to punish those who had not cooperated activated reward circuits in the brain, lending credence to the phrase Revenge is sweet (Fehr & Rockenbach, 2004). Unfortunately, the willingness to pay a big price to carry out revenge against those who seem unfair might also lead to irrational acts, such as suicide bombings. However, other instances of altruism do not fit these models. People have been known to adopt unrelated children. Arland Williams, a passenger on an airplane that crashed into the freezing Potomac River in 1982, passed lifelines to other passengers before disappearing beneath the water. These altruistic acts represent psychological altruism, or conscious efforts to help. This type of altruism can be transmitted by a culture through learning (Dawkins, 1976). The role of learning in altruism is supported by observations that the tendency to feel pleasure when helping others is quite low in children and gradually increases into adulthood (Cialdini, Kenrick, & Baumann, 1981). Sensational (though inaccurate) news accounts of the murder of Kitty Genovese stimulated research in bystander intervention, which asked questions about why people seem to help in some situations but not others. If cooperation confers so many benefits to individuals and groups, how can we explain the failure of some individuals to provide help when it is desperately needed? In 1964, a young woman named Kitty Genovese was murdered on a New York City street near her home late at night. Sensational news reports at the time stated that 38 of her neighbors watched for more than half an hour while Kitty struggled with her attacker without intervening or calling the police. Although these reports were not confirmed by later court testimony in the case (Manning, Levine, & Collins, 2007), the public outrage that they stimulated led to a series of experiments into bystander interventionbystander interventionThe study of situational variables related to helping a stranger, most notably the decreased likelihood of helping as the number of bystanders increases            bystander intervention        The study of situational variables related to helping a stranger, most notably the decreased likelihood of helping as the number of bystanders increases            . This research demonstrated that an individual’s likelihood of helping drops as the number of other observers grows. In a typical experiment investigating this phenomenon, college students filled out a questionnaire as their room filled with smoke (Latané & Darley, 1968). The researchers were interested in how frequently and quickly the students reported the smoke. When the college students were alone, nearly 80% sought help within 6 minutes. When three study participants were tested together, however, only 40% reported the emergency within 6 minutes. The effect of the number of observers on the likelihood of intervention is probably influenced by a sense of individual responsibility. When you are the only person available to help, your responsibility is clear. When a crowd of people is gathered around the scene of an accident, it is easier to assume that others have already called 911 or that a physician or nurse who is better qualified to help will be present. People also fail to act because of fears of appearing foolish as a result of misinterpreting a situation. Emergencies sometimes can be ambiguous. What sounds like a case of domestic violence next door might be a loud movie or video game or actors practicing a scene for a play. People who feel anonymous are less likely to help, which is consistent with our previous observations of how anonymity can lead to less socially desirable behavior. Finally, people are more likely to help when it is safe and convenient for them to do so. If you are heading for your car at the end of the day when you notice a classmate with a flat tire, you are likely to lend a hand. However, if you are late for work or a final exam, you may conveniently assume that someone else will take care of the situation as you continue on your way. AggressionAggressionThe conscious intent to harm another.            Aggression        The conscious intent to harm another.             is the conscious intent to harm others, and it can take several forms. Instrumental aggression is the intentional harm, usually physical, done to others to obtain a goal, such as attacking a person to steal a wallet or purse. Relational aggression harms another person’s social standing through behaviors such as ignoring, excluding, and gossiping. Other types of aggression include defensive aggression, in which the person may do harm to others in self-defense; passive aggression, in which people who aren’t comfortable being openly aggressive get what they want under the guise of still trying to please others; and maternal aggression, a rather common phenomenon in the animal world (and occasionally among humans) in which sickly or unwanted offspring are killed. Like most of the behaviors discussed in this textbook, factors leading to human aggression form complex interactions. Efforts to find simple correlations between violence and single variables such as economic growth, population trends, illegal drug trade, availability of guns, and domestic violence versus stranger violence do not tell the whole story. We can capture the flavor of this complexity by examining homicide rates across cultures. The average homicide rate worldwide is about 10 per 100,000 residents per year, or twice the number killed in war (UNODC, 2014). South Africa has a murder rate of 60 homicides per 100,000 residents, compared to Singapore’s rate of 0.2 per 100,000 (UNODC, 2014). Rates in large cities within the United States vary substantially, from 50.3 homicides per 100,000 residents of St. Louis, Missouri, to 0.4 per 100,000 in Honolulu (FBI, 2010). Across all cultures, women are more likely than men to be killed by intimate partners or family members, but rates again vary. Only 24% of female victims in Australia are killed by someone they don’t know, while 66% of female victims in Singapore don’t know their murderer (UNODC, 2014). Is a capacity for aggression simply part of being human? Biological explanations of aggression point to several possible sources of human aggression: genetics, biochemistry, and nervous system structure and activity. Aggression is clearly a disposition that can be selectively bred in animals, as evidenced by the development of the famous fighting bulls of Spain and hyperaggressive laboratory mice (Lagerspetz & Lagerspetz, 1983). Human twin and adoption studies imply that aggressive tendencies in humans are at least partly influenced by genetics (Rushton, Fulker, Neale, Nias, & Eysenck, 1986). As we have seen so frequently in this textbook, genes associated with aggressive behavior interact with nurture or experience. Among children who were abused, those with one version of a gene linked to aggression in animals were likely to behave aggressively, while those with the other form rarely did so, even when the abuse experienced was severe (Craig, 2007;  Fergusson, Boden, Horwood, Miller, & Kennedy, 2011). Both naturally occurring chemicals and recreational drugs can influence aggression. Among the naturally occurring chemicals implicated in aggression are androgens, or male hormones such as testosterone (see Figure 13.19). Prenatal exposure to high levels of androgens, which can occur naturally or because of medications occasionally given to pregnant women, increases the aggressive play of both male and female preschoolers (Reinisch, Ziemba-Davis, & Sanders, 1991). Adult men with higher levels of prenatal testosterone exposure score higher on standardized questionnaires of aggression (Bailey & Hurd, 2005;  Burton, Henninger, Hafetz, & Cofer, 2009). Testosterone levels on the high end of the typical range in teen and adult males are positively correlated with delinquency, drug abuse, and aggression (Dabbs & Morris, 1990). Testosterone levels for both male and female criminals correlate with the violent nature of the crimes for which they were sentenced, as well as the dominance and violence that they demonstrate while in prison (Dabbs, Frady, Carr, & Besch, 1987;  Dabbs & Hargrove, 1997). Testosterone appears to affect aggressive behavior by increasing the sensitivity of the amygdala to threatening stimuli, such as angry faces (Derntl et al., 2009). When feeling threatened, a person might engage in more aggressive behavior as a preemptive strike. Both male and female preschoolers who had been exposed prenatally to higher than normal levels of testosterone were more physically aggressive than their same-sex siblings who experienced normal levels of prenatal testosterone. Serotonin levels are negatively correlated with aggressive behavior. Male vervet monkeys form precise social hierarchies, and higher rank is associated with higher levels of serotonin activity (Raleigh, Brammer, McGuire, Pollack, & Yuwiler, 1992). Monkeys at the bottom of the hierarchy had lower serotonin levels and were much more aggressive than high-status monkeys. Serotonin might reduce aggression by enhancing empathy (Siegel & Crockett, 2013) or by promoting activity in frontal-lobe areas associated with inhibiting impulsive behavior (Heinz, Beck, Meyer-Lindenberg, Sterzer, & Heinz, 2011). Many psychoactive substances affect the likelihood that a person will behave aggressively. For instance, alcohol has been implicated in between 32% and 63% of violent crimes (Giancola, 2013). In addition, many suicides are committed under the influence of alcohol (Sher, 2006). The most likely mode of action for alcohol in stimulating aggression is its general disinhibiting effects on behavior. As discussed in Chapter 4, alcohol silences higher cortical areas responsible for impulse control, often leading to behavior that is normally actively suppressed, including aggression. Keeping in mind the complexity of human aggression, we can point to variations in brain structure and function that are associated with senseless violence. Antisocial, violent behavior is correlated with some types of brain damage, although these findings interact with experience in ways similar to the genetics studies discussed earlier (Davidson, Putnam, & Larson, 2000). The diversity of patterns of brain activity leading to aggression was demonstrated in a study comparing brain activity in murderers who had experienced neglect, poverty, physical abuse, or sexual abuse and murderers who had experienced none of these social deficits (Raine, Stoddard, Bihrle, & Buchsbaum, 1998). The brain activity of the neglected and abused murderers was quite similar to the nonviolent control participants. In contrast, the brain activity of the nonabused murderers was quite different, suggesting that their violent behavior had different roots than in the murderers with a history of child abuse. The nonabused individuals showed an unusually reduced level of activity in the frontal lobes. Given the essential role of the frontal lobes in higher-order judgment and impulse control, this lower level of activity might help account for their inability to control their aggression. These brain images were taken from (a) a person with no history of criminal behavior, (b) a person who was convicted of murder and had a strong history of childhood abuse and neglect, and (c) a person who was convicted of murder but had no history of childhood abuse or neglect. The murderer who had been abused and neglected shows activity that is similar to that of the person without a criminal history. The murderer with no history of abuse or neglect shows little activity in the frontal lobes (toward the top of the image) or in the middle parts of the brain that usually respond to emotional stimuli. Although it is probably safe to say that our human heritage contains a capacity for aggression, the actual expression of aggression is elicited by environmental factors and modified by experience. As discussed in Chapter 8, Albert Bandura provided compelling evidence that children who observe aggression are likely to behave aggressively themselves (Bandura, 1973). In Bandura’s classic demonstration of social learning, preschoolers who observed an adult attack an inflatable Bobo doll mimicked not just the violent actions, but also the yells of Sock him in the nose, Knock him down, and Kick him. Opportunities to observe violence are plentiful. Within the family, children who are disciplined with screaming, slapping, and beating are more likely to be physically aggressive with their peers at school (Patterson, Chamberlain, & Reid, 1982). Even when the parents are violent toward each other, without involving the child directly, the child’s level of violent behavior may be affected. In a study of more than 2,000 violent children and teens, recent exposure to violence in the home was a useful predictor for the child’s violent behavior outside the home (Singer, Miller, Guo, Slovak, & Frierson, 1998). Additional opportunities to observe violence are provided by the media. By the age of 18, the average American has seen an estimated 200,000 acts of violence on television alone (Strasburger, 2007). Statistics show that 61% of television programming includes violence, with only 4% featuring an antiviolence theme (Federman, 1998). Children and youth are exposed to increasingly violent and graphic images and ideas through films, video games, and music lyrics. As discussed in Chapter 2, however, care must be taken to avoid misinterpretation of the research results showing correlations between media exposure and aggression. The human species loses a smaller percentage of the population to war today than in the time of our hunter–gatherer ancestors (LeBlanc, 2003), but we still have a long way to go. As in the case of reducing prejudice, redefining the boundaries of the in-group might be contributing to this improvement. Instead of hunter–gatherer clans of 100 or so individuals fighting with neighboring clans, we have nations of millions that cooperate as units. Increasing economic dependencies among nations further reduces the advantages of between-group violence. Damage to one nation’s critical infrastructure, such as its ability to produce or process oil, is likely to have adverse effects for all nations, including the attacker. Despite this progress, we remain plagued not only by continued war deaths, but also by homicides, domestic violence, rape, bullying, and other destructive aggressive behavior. Psychologists continue to search for effective ways to reduce aggression. There are no simple solutions to the problem of aggression. You might think that we could take advantage of catharsis, or the reduction of an emotion through its expression, but the research results do not support this approach. Catharsis theories of aggression are common but suffer from the same weaknesses shown by catharsis explanations of emotion discussed in Chapter 7. Just as expressing an emotion typically heightens rather than decreasing a feeling, people who engage in aggression experience an increase in aggression. In one typical experiment, participants first were angered by a person who criticized essays they had written (Bushman, 2002). Subsequently, the participants who were given opportunities to hit a punching bag while thinking about the critic administered louder sound blasts to the critic when given the opportunity to retaliate than did participants in control groups. Despite the intuitive appeal of the notion of catharsis, when it comes to aggression, catharsis is generally ineffective. Research using surveillance camera footage shows that third parties often intervene in an effort to deescalate violence (Levine, Taylor, & Best, 2011). Unlike most laboratory studies of bystander intervention, third parties in the filmed incidents were more, not less, likely to intervene as groups of onlookers became larger. Further research should help clarify the exact conditions leading to helping behavior. Another frequent suggestion for reducing aggression that has failed to gain research support is an active teaching approach in which children are rewarded for sensitivity and cooperation. Cross-cultural data show that homicide rates are often high in cultures that feature a loving socialization of children and aversion to interpersonal conflict, such as the Inuit, !Kung Bushmen, and Gebusi of New Zealand, yet very low among cultures where children are explicitly taught to fight, like the Turkana of Kenya (Dyson-Hudson & Dyson-Hudson, 1999; Dyson-Hudson & Dyson-Hudson, 1995). Much of the research discussed so far in this chapter focuses on individual variables, whether they are related to a person’s genetic makeup or socialization. To truly understand aggression, we need to zoom out to see this behavior within the social context. For example, we know that if groups rarely interact, they are more likely to fight than to cooperate. In contrast, if groups interact regularly and anticipate future interactions, they may still compete, but they tend to do so in more prosocial ways. The social environment also can determine whether aggressiveness escalates to actual violence. In a study using surveillance footage of public places, researchers observed actual fighting behavior (Levine, Taylor, & Best, 2011). In many cases, one or more third parties (usually friends of the combatants) intervened to stop the fight. In an interesting contrast with the helping behavior observed in the bystander intervention literature discussed previously, third parties are more likely, not less likely, to intervene in a fight when the number of bystanders is larger. Perhaps the implications of the aggression spreading to include the whole group makes stopping the fight a very high priority for members of the group. Homicides among the Turkana of Kenya are quite rare, even though children are explicitly encouraged to be aggressive toward one another, under the watchful eyes of adults. However, the Turkana are exceedingly aggressive toward their neighbors. Over human history, the trait of aggression has probably been valued when turned against other groups, but not when it is turned inward. The advent of the internet is changing our social interactions right in front of our eyes. Classic research reviewed earlier in this chapter showed that Americans typically married someone who lived within five blocks of their home (Bossard, 1932). The Internet has changed all of that. Between 2005 and 2012, a surprising number of Americans, one out of three, met their spouses online (Cacioppo, Cacioppo, Gonzaga, Ogburn, & VanderWeele, 2013). Despite the comfort level of younger adults with the Internet, 30- to 39-year-olds were more likely to have met their spouse online than were those under 30. Those who met their spouse online were also more educated and had higher incomes, suggesting that the Internet has provided busy people opportunities to socialize. Marriages begun online were slightly but significantly less likely to end in divorce or separation than marriages begun offline (see Figure 13.20). Online marriage partners rated their marriages as more satisfying. Even when factors such as age, education, and income were controlled, because these might account for higher satisfaction by themselves, the online marriages remained more successful. Researchers at eHarmony reported that their now-married clients are much less likely to divorce than couples meeting in more traditional ways, such as through school, family, church, and work. What other factors might account for the success of the online marriages? People who seek a spouse online might differ from those who don’t in important ways. Perhaps they are more motivated to maintain long-term relationships, or they might be more selective in their choices. Self-disclosure differs in the online and offline settings, leading to greater liking for people you meet in the online realm (Cacioppo et al., 2013). Finally, the matching algorithms used by online dating sites might result in people finding more compatible partners than they would through chance meetings in their face-to-face lives. Further research is necessary to fully understand the impact of online meetings on relationship outcomes, but these initial results indicate that many Americans are using online dating with surprising success. In this chapter, you have read about a number of studies that explored the phenomenon of bystander intervention, or the circumstances in which a person is most likely to offer help to others in distress. Bystanders can play a significant role in the perpetration of both traditional bullying and cyberbullying. They can either reinforce the bully, increasing the harm done to the victim, or they can attempt to stop the bullying, which could decrease the harm done to the victim (Bastiaensens et al., 2016) (see Figure 13.21). What determines the path that the bystander chooses? Teens were asked if they would imitate cyberbullying in the presence of bystanders who were reinforcing a bully or defending the victim, when those bystanders were either good friends or acquaintances. In the presence of good friends who were supporting the bully, the teens indicated a greater likelihood of modeling the bullying behavior. The type of bystander (friend or acquaintance) had less impact on whether a teen would defend the victim. Not too surprisingly, given our social nature and dependency on our social groups, having good friends who approve of and participate in cyberbullying is more important to predicting when bystanders will join in than having acquaintances who bully (Bastiaensens et al., 2016). The severity of the bullying also plays a role, as bystanders were more likely to intervene on behalf of a victim when the bullying was perceived as severe (Bastiaensens et al., 2014). Finally, the amount of exposure to cyberbullying experienced by a bystander might contribute indirectly to their participation by lowering empathy (Pabian, Vandebosch, Poels, Van Cleemput, & Bastiaensens, 2016). These empirical results seem particularly relevant to the design of effective interventions aimed at reducing the frequency of cyberbullying. Identifying one cyberbully could lead to interventions aimed at the cyberbully’s social circle as well. Reframing all cyberbullying as severe could increase the likelihood that bystanders would intervene on behalf of a victim. Recognizing that continuing exposure to cyberbullying on the part of bystanders reduces empathy could promote increased efforts at empathy training. What Is It?
