export const text = `Taste buds contained in the papillae of the tongue are far more responsive to bitter tastes than to sweet tastes. Studying the Science of Psychology can lead you to see yourself and other people in completely new ways. Hundreds of years ago, people believed that the world was flat and the Sun and stars circled the Earth. Careful scientific research slowly dispelled these inaccurate notions. Nonetheless, we hold tightly to many equally false commonsense beliefs about the human mind and behavior. We all know that opposites attract, but we also know that birds of a feather flock together—so why do we need psychology to tell us what we already know? The problem is that both statements cannot be true at the same time, so the real state of affairs is neither obvious nor simple. Just as careful science was required to understand our planet’s place in the universe, the same scientific techniques are providing us with a more accurate, complete view of the human mind. Let’s begin with a seemingly simple and familiar example: our ability to taste. We know a lot about taste—what we like or dislike, the different qualities of taste, and so on. Most of us can taste sweetness in a solution made of 1 part sugar and 200 parts water. As remarkable as this sensitivity appears to be, however, people can detect 1 part bitter substance (like quinine or the chemicals in broccoli) in 2 million parts water. This contrast in taste sensitivity between sweet and bitter does not reflect the actual difference between sweet and bitter substances—that is, bitter tastes are not 10,000 times stronger than sweet tastes—but rather how we experience them. Why would we have such a vast difference in sensitivity between these types of tastes?Our personal experience of taste does not help us much in answering this question, but psychological science can. As it turns out, our greater sensitivity to bitter tastes is highly adaptive: Most poisons or toxins taste bitter, and if you want to stay alive, it is more important to avoid swallowing poison than to enjoy something sweet. Being far more sensitive to tastes that are bitter is a trait that has served our species well because it helps us avoid eating things that could kill us. Psychology helps us understand why we do the things we do by providing a context for understanding the mind and behavior. Introspection is the personal observation of our own thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Because we are not perfect observers of the operations of our own minds, psychologists developed other methods that provide scientific insight into the mind. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan, areas of the brain that were more active when participants were hungry than when they were full are highlighted. Through technology, researchers can better understand how the brain regulates hunger. To gain that understanding, psychology addresses questions from multiple scientific perspectives. One can think of this like the zoom feature in Google Earth. In some parts of this textbook, we will zoom in on human behaviors, like looking at the highly magnified image of the papillae on the tongue (pictured on page 2), which allow us to taste, and trace the messages about taste sent from the tongue to the brain. At other times, we’ll zoom out, to take in the larger picture and better understand why the boy on the previous page is giving his bitter-tasting broccoli a skeptical look. Psychologists approach the study of mind using various in-depth perspectives, which will be described in this chapter. For example, we can look at the little boy’s reaction to his broccoli from a developmental perspective, which tells us that taste sensitivity decreases over the life span. Using a biological perspective, we can determine the neural mechanisms responsible for the difference in taste sensitivity. Or, using the social perspective, we can think about social influences like culture on food preferences. Cottage cheese, enjoyed by many Americans, is viewed with disgust in some other parts of the world. Meanwhile, fruit bat pie, a delicacy in Palau, might not be a popular item in the United States. Although single perspectives can tell us a lot about a phenomenon like our sensitivity to bitter tastes, no one perspective can give us a complete answer. The best view comes from putting multiple perspectives together. You can learn a lot about your house by zooming in on it in Google Earth, but when you see how your home fits into the larger context of city, state, country, and planet, that viewpoint adds something special to your understanding. We’ll start by learning more about psychology’s main perspectives, along with a little background about their origins. Our approach to these perspectives is consistent with recent recommendations for teaching introductory psychology made by the American Psychological Association’s Board of Educational Affairs (Gurung et al., 2014). Once we understand these perspectives, we’ll be in a better position to understand how they come together to give us the big picture.The study of the mind The brain and its activities, including thought, emotion, and behavior.        mind        The brain and its activities, including thought, emotion, and behavior. is as fascinating as it is complex. Psychological scientists view the mind as a way of talking about the activities of the brain, including thought, emotion, and behavior. A quick look at this textbook’s table of contents will show you the variety of approaches to mind that you will encounter, such as the thinking mind (cognitive psychology) and the troubled mind (abnormal psychology). The word psychology is a combination of two Greek words: psyche (or psuche), or soul, and logos, meaning the objective study of. For the ancient Greeks, a soul was close to our modern view of a spirit or mind. Logos is the source of all our ologies, such as biology and anthropology. Literally translated, therefore, psychologypsychologyThe scientific study of behavior, mental processes, and brain functions.        psychology        The scientific study of behavior, mental processes, and brain functions. means the objective study of the mind. Contemporary definitions of psychology refine and update this basic meaning. Today’s psychologists define their field as the scientific study of behavior, mental processes, and brain functions—that is, the scientific study of the mind. Increased recognition that the brain is the organ of the mind has led many psychology departments to expand their names to the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences (or the equivalent). The phrase behavior, mental processes, and brain functions has undergone several changes over the history of psychology. Behavior refers to any action that we can observe. As we will see in Chapter 2, observation has been an important tool for psychologists from the early days of the discipline. Our definition does not specify whose behavior is to be examined. Although the bulk of psychology focuses on human behavior, animal behavior has been an essential part of the discipline, both for understanding animals better and for comparing and contrasting animal and human behavior. The study of both mental processes and brain functions has been highly dependent on the methods available to psychologists. Early efforts to study mental processes were generally unsatisfactory because they relied on the use of introspectionintrospectionA personal observation of your own thoughts, feelings, and behavior.        introspection        A personal observation of your own thoughts, feelings, and behavior., or the personal observation of your own thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Because it is difficult for others to confirm your introspections, this subjective approach does not lend itself well to the scientific method. If you say that you are feeling hungry, how can anyone else know whether your observation is accurate? In addition, your mind and behavior are governed by a host of structures, factors and processes, most of which are not available through introspection. Innovations in the methods and mathematics used to investigate brain activity and behavior have allowed psychologists to revisit the question of mental processes and brain functions with greater objectivity and success. Most readers of this book are not pursuing careers in psychology, so how will this material help you in your chosen career? Psychology is all about people, and nearly all occupations require an understanding of people and their behavior. An architect cannot design a functional space without considering how people respond to being crowded. An attorney cannot cross-examine a witness without an understanding of memory, motivation, emotion, and stress. A teacher cannot encourage students to reach their potential without an understanding of child development and learning. Business leaders and economists cannot predict the movements of markets without understanding the minds making the relevant decisions. The study of psychology, then, provides you with better insight into and understanding of many occupations and fields of study. You probably have seen applications that allow you to map your friendship networks on social media, with shorter links indicating greater connectivity and larger bubbles indicating more overlapping friendships with another person. Kevin Boyack and his colleagues generated a similar map of the sciences (see Figure 1.1) but used reference lists in journal articles instead of friendship networks (Boyack, Klavans, & Börner, 2005). The resulting map shows the extent to which each of the sciences are influential and what other sciences they most influence. Boyack and colleagues referred to the most influential sciences as hub sciences. Their analysis shows that psychology is one of the seven major hub sciences, with strong connections to the medical sciences, the social sciences, and education. In the upcoming chapters of this book, we will highlight these connections with examples that are relevant to each particular chapter. This map of science was generated by comparing citations from more than 1 million papers published in more than 7,000 journals since 2000. Psychology appears among the seven major areas of science, indicated in the map by a different font. The other six major areas are social sciences, mathematics, physics, chemistry, earth sciences, and medicine.The empiricist philosophers had a profound influence on the foundations of American political thought—that all of us are created equal. For generations, Europe had been ruled by people who were born into positions of power instead of earning the privilege of leading through hard work and education. If knowledge is not innate or inborn, any of us can learn enough to grow up to be president. Psychology is a relatively young discipline, dating back only to the 1870s. However, topics that interest modern psychologists go back farther in the history of human thought. People living as long ago as 6000 to 5000 bce in Assyria described their dreams (Restak, 1988). Among these accounts are descriptions of being chased, which are still among the most common dreams that people experience (Nielsen et al., 2003). See Figure 1.2 for common dream themes. Although we don’t understand why we dream about certain things, many people report similar themes in their dreams. The psychology family tree includes two major roots: philosophyphilosophyThe discipline that systematically examines basic concepts, including the source of knowledge.        philosophy        The discipline that systematically examines basic concepts, including the source of knowledge. and the natural sciences Sciences that study the physical and biological events that occur in nature.        natural sciences        Sciences that study the physical and biological events that occur in nature.. Psychologists answer questions traditionally posed by philosophers by borrowing the methods of the natural sciences. We examine scientific methods in detail in Chapter 2.Philosophers and psychologists share an interest in questions regarding the nature of the self, the effects of early experience, the existence of free will, and the origin of knowledge. Both disciplines consider the relative balance of biological factors (nature) and environmental factors (nurture) in the resulting human behavior. Both attempt to determine the relationships between self-interest and community welfare, between body and mind, and between humans and other species with which we share the planet. Although we typically consider questions of the unconscious mind and abnormal behavior to be the realm of the psychologist, philosophers investigated these issues thousands of years before the first psychologist was born. One of the most significant questions shared by philosophy and psychology asks whether the mind is inborn or is formed through experience. (a) Philosophers beginning with Aristotle (384–322 bce) believed that all knowledge is gained through sensory experience. (b) Beginning in the 17th century, this idea flourished in the British philosophical school of empiricism. Empiricists, like John Locke, viewed the mind as a blank slate at birth, which then was filled with ideas gained by observing the world. (c) Contemporary psychologists believe that experience interacts with inborn characteristics to shape the mind. Intelligence, for example, is influenced by both genetics and experience. During the 1970s, Romanian orphans adopted at young ages recovered from the effects of their seriously deprived social circumstances, but those who endured years of deprivation had more severe cognitive deficits (Ames, 1997).Running along a parallel track to the early philosophers, ancient physicians were laying the foundation of our biological knowledge of the brain and nervous system, discussed in greater detail in Chapter 4. During this pursuit, physicians helped develop the scientific methods that would become central to contemporary psychology and previewed the application of the knowledge that they gained to the improvement of individual well-being. Ancient people might have attempted to cure headaches, seizures, or psychological disorders by drilling holes in the skull. Bone growth around the hole indicates that some patients survived the procedure. Until fairly recently, the whole of medicine remained a primitive business. Beginning in the 17th and 18th centuries, scientists armed with new technologies, including the light microscope (see Figure 1.3), began to make a series of important discoveries about the human body and mind. For example, they demonstrated that a single sensory nerve carried one type of information instead of multiple types. You might have already duplicated this research yourself while rubbing your sleepy eyes—you see a flash of light. The nerves serving the retina of the eye do not know how to process information about touch or pressure. When stimulated, they are capable of only one type of message—light. Hermann von Helmholtz (1821–1894) asked his participants to push a button when they felt a touch. When a thigh was touched, participants reacted faster than when a toe was touched. Because the toe is farther from the brain than the thigh, signals from the toe required more time to reach the brain. These types of discoveries about the physical aspects of mind convinced scientists that the mind was not supernatural and could be studied scientifically. This light microscope was used by Anton von Leeuwenhoek to discover red blood cells in 1676. Microscopes opened a new world to scientists interested in living things. A = Screw for adjusting the height of the object being examinedB = Metal plate serving as the bodyC = Skewer to impale the object and rotate itD = Lens, which was sphericalPhilosophers began to incorporate physiological and psychological concepts into their work, and natural scientists began to explore the questions asked by philosophers. The gradual merger of these approaches resulted in a series of experiments that looked increasingly like contemporary psychology. Scientists began to ask questions about the relationships between physical stimulation and its resulting sensations. For example, Gustav Fechner (1801–1889) was able to identify the softest sound that a person could hear by randomly presenting sounds of different intensities to which a participant would respond yes or no. When the yes responses reached 50%, Fechner concluded that the sound was within the range that the human ear could detect (see Chapter 5). Although Fechner’s research seems very similar to Helmholtz’s, note the importance of mental processes in Fechner’s work, as opposed to the simple measurement of physiology in Helmholtz’s experiment. The stage was set for a modern science of psychology. The work of Hermann von Helmholtz (1821–1894) on reaction time helped establish the mind as something that could be studied scientifically. Person or groupThings to rememberAncient Greek philosophersObservations can be accounted for by natural, not supernatural, explanations. British empiricistsKnowledge is the result of experience. Ancient physiciansThe brain is the source of the mind.17th- and 18th-century natural scientistsDiscoveries about sensation and movement showed that the mind was physical. Hermann von HelmholtzStudies of reaction time reinforced the idea of the mind as physical.As psychology developed from the gradual merger of philosophical questions and scientific reasoning, the young discipline struggled to determine which questions and methods were best suited to its goals. Lively debates arose among psychologists who helped to shape the field.The credit for being the first psychologist goes to Wilhelm Wundt (1832–1920), a former research assistant to von Helmholtz, who conducted the first documented psychological experiment in his laboratory at the University of Leipzig in 1879. This landmark experiment was a simple test of reaction time: How quickly after hearing a ball drop onto a platform could a person respond by striking a telegraph key?Wilhelm Wundt (1832–1920), seated in this photo, is considered the first experimental psychologist. We have given credit to Wilhelm Wundt for conducting the first experiments in psychology. What did those crucial first experiments look like?Wundt’s experiments reflected both his interests in consciousness and his training as a medical doctor. He was aware of methods that were used by researchers in physiology, such as the reaction-time measures pioneered by F. C. Donders in the Netherlands, and he sought to apply these methods to measure psychological processes such as attention and decision making (Danziger & Ballantyne, 1997). The Questions: Is it possible to time mental processes? Are simple reaction times different from reaction times involving choices?Wundt’s methods involved two sets of apparatus: one that would deliver a stimulus precisely to a participant, and a second that would measure and record the participant’s responses. His imposing-looking brass instruments used to carry out these tasks were displayed to an admiring public at the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair. The first experiments carried out by Wundt involved the presentation of stimuli, such as the sound of a ball dropped onto a platform, and measurements of reaction time, as indicated by the participant pressing a telegraph key. In addition to these simple reaction-time experiments, Wundt asked participants to make decisions: When you see this light, press the button on the left, but if you see that light, press the button on the right. As you continue reading your textbook, you will review a number of experiments like this one. Many will highlight important ethical considerations regarding the treatment of participants. These ethical concerns will be reviewed in more detail in Chapter 2, but in the meantime, Wundt’s experiment appears to have posed little risk to his participants. After you consider the criteria for conducting ethical research outlined in Chapter 2, however, you might want to return to this description and see if you agree with our assessment or not. Wundt viewed reaction time as mental chronometry (Hergenhahn & Henley, 2013, p. 255). In other words, he believed that reaction time provided a measure of the amount of mental processing required to carry out a task. As his tasks became more complex, reaction time increased accordingly. As mentioned earlier in this chapter, Wundt’s mentor, Hermann von Helmholtz, had performed a number of experiments similar to those performed by Wundt. Von Helmholtz touched the participant on the thigh and toe and discovered that the participant pushed a button faster in response to the thigh touch than the toe touch. What makes von Helmholtz’s demonstration a physiological experiment and Wundt’s a psychology experiment?Part of the answer is the interpretation that each scientist made of his results. For von Helmholtz, differences in reaction time in these two instances represented the effects of the speed of conduction of neural signaling. Because the toe is farther from the brain than the thigh is, messages from the toe take more time to reach the brain. Wundt’s simple reaction-time experiments were not that different, but his experiments on choice were more clearly psychological. As decisions became more complex, reaction time increased. Max Wertheimer (1880–1943) was one of the founders of Gestalt psychology. Wundt saw mental experience as a hierarchy. The mind constructs an overall perception (the food I’m eating tastes good) out of building blocks made up of separate sensations, such as taste and vision, and emotional responses. One of Wundt’s students, Edward Titchener (1867–1923), expanded on Wundt’s views to establish a theory of structuralismstructuralismAn approach in which the mind is broken into the smallest elements of mental experience        structuralism        An approach in which the mind is broken into the smallest elements of mental experience, in which the mind could be broken down into the smallest elements of mental experience. Titchener’s approach to psychology paralleled the general trends in the physical sciences of his day, such as efforts in chemistry to break molecules into elements and attempts by physicists to describe matter at the level of the atom.The structuralists’ effort to break behavior into its essential elements was rejected by a group of early 20th-century German psychologists, including Kurt Koffka, Max Wertheimer, and Wolfgang Köhler, who founded Gestalt psychologyGestalt psychologyAn approach that saw experience as being different from the sum of its elements.        Gestalt psychology        An approach that saw experience as being different from the sum of its elements.. Gestalt, although lacking a clear translation into English, basically means form or whole. The Gestalt psychologists believed that breaking a whole perception into its building blocks, as advocated by the structuralists, would result in the loss of some important psychological information. For example, look at the middle image in Figure 1.4. It is the same in both the top and the bottom rows, yet in the context of the first row, most people interpret the image as the letter B, and in the context of the bottom row, the image looks like the number 13. The structuralists would have a difficult time explaining why the same visual building blocks could lead to such different conclusions. Participants usually see the middle figure as a B when instructed to look at the first row, but see a 13 when instructed to read the second row, even though the images are exactly the same. Structuralists, who believed that experiences could be reduced to small building blocks, would have difficulty explaining these results. In contrast, Gestalt psychologists, who emphasized the role of context or the whole in perception, would have no problem.While the structuralists and Gestalt psychologists continued their debate, a new type of psychology emerged, partly in response to the publication of Charles Darwin’s The Origin of Species in 1859 and The Descent of Man in 1871. FunctionalismFunctionalismAn approach that saw behavior as purposeful and contributing to survival        Functionalism        An approach that saw behavior as purposeful and contributing to survival viewed behavior as purposeful because it led to survival. Instead of restricting themselves to exploring the structure of the mind, functionalists were more interested in why behavior and mental processes worked in a particular way. William James (1842–1910) proposed functionalism, an approach to the mind that viewed behavior as purposeful. Functionalism’s chief proponent was William James (1842–1910), whose textbook, Principles of Psychology (1890), dominated the field of psychology for 50 years. There are few topics in psychology that James did not address in his book, and many of his ideas sound modern. For example, he coined the term stream of consciousness to describe the flow of ideas that people experience while awake. Throughout his discussions of mental processes and behavior, James emphasized the role of evolution. For the functionalist, the value of an activity depended on its consequences. If we enjoy ice cream, it must be because eating sweet, high-fat foods enhances survival—at least it did for our ancestors, for whom famine was more of a problem than obesity. Mary Whiton Calkins (1863–1930) was a student of William James at Harvard University, although she could not officially register because of her gender. She studied memory and the self and served as president of the American Psychological Association in 1905. It is difficult to overestimate the impact of James on psychology. Structuralism came and went, but all contemporary psychologists are functionalists at heart. As described by two psychology historians, As a systematic point of view, functionalism was an overwhelming success, but largely because of this success it is no longer a distinct school of psychology. It was absorbed into the mainstream psychology. No happier fate could await any psychological point of view (Chaplin & Krawiec, 1979, p. 53).When a case of capital punishment is discussed, we often hear about the prisoner’s terrible childhood from one side of the argument and the need to protect society from further misdeeds by this person from the other side. Where would the Freudians and humanistic psychologists line up in this debate?With the exception of occasional bursts of insight from the ancient Egyptians and Greeks, the most common view of psychological disorders over the course of history has been the supernatural approach. According to this view, psychological disorders resulted from the actions of evil spirits or other external, magical forces. Between the 17th and the 19th centuries, supernatural explanations for psychological disorders began to give way to two scientific approaches: a medical model and a psychological model. The medical model of psychological disorder emphasized physical causes of abnormal behavior and medical treatments, such as medication. The psychological model suggested that abnormal behavior can result from life experiences, leading to fear, anxiety, and other counterproductive emotional responses. Psychological treatments take many forms, from offering support to applying cognitive and behavioral methods to help people think and problem-solve in new ways. As Chapters 14 and 15 will explain, contemporary psychologists typically combine these approaches to understand disorders and develop effective treatments. For example, we know that feeling depressed has both physical components (changes in the activity of chemical messengers in the brain) and experiential components (exposure to stressful situations). Treatment for depression often combines medication with efforts to change the way a person thinks about situations. You have read about a number of reaction-time experiments in this chapter, including those conducted by Hermann von Helmholtz and Wilhelm Wundt. It is possible to conduct similar experiments without the brass equipment used by these early researchers. This exercise, developed by Dr. Erik Chudler of the University of Washington, is designed to measure your reaction time to a visual stimulus. All you need is a partner and a simple footlong ruler. Hold the ruler vertically, with the highest numbers at the top, and ask your partner to place a hand at the bottom of the ruler without touching it. Tell your partner that you will drop the ruler sometime in the next 5 seconds and to grab the ruler as quickly as possible and hold it. Note the number at the top of the person’s hand after the ruler is caught, and use this chart to convert your results to reaction time. Number on ruler at top of person’s handReaction time2 in.

Wundt eventually discarded reaction time as a measure because he became so frustrated with the variability that he observed among participants and across tasks (Hergenhahn & Henley, 2013), but you can have some fun exploring these same sources of variability. Are you faster than your friends? Try testing people who are older than you. Are they faster or slower? Do your participants improve with practice? What happens to your reaction time if you dim the lights?Measuring the spot where a person catches a falling ruler gives you a rough estimate of that individual’s reaction time to a visual stimulus. Sigmund Freud (1856–1939) built a bridge from his medical training as a physician to his belief in the impact of life experiences on behavior. His psychodynamic theory and its applications to the treatment of psychological disorders dominated much of psychological thinking for the first half of the 20th century. Freud’s ideas about the existence of the unconscious mind, the development of sexuality, dream analysis, and psychological roots of abnormal behavior influenced not just psychology, but also culture. He nearly single-handedly founded the study of personality in psychology, a topic explored more fully in Chapter 12. He developed the techniques of psychoanalysis for treating mental disorders, which are discussed in Chapter 15. He popularized the use of psychological principles for explaining everyday behavior, and his theories are as likely to be covered in an English literature course as in a psychology course. The work of Sigmund Freud (1856–1939) on consciousness, sexuality, abnormal behavior, and psychotherapy played a dominant role in psychology during the first half of the 20th century. Our enthusiasm for Freud is tempered by a number of valid concerns. As you read further about Freud, keep in mind that his methods were not scientific. His theories are based on observations of his patients, primarily upper-class Viennese housewives who were not typical of the human population. Freud’s theories do not lend themselves to experimentation, an essential requirement for any scientific theory, as discussed further in Chapter 2. For example, how could you design an experiment to demonstrate that dreaming about water indicates you have unconscious concerns about sex? Finally, although psychoanalysis is still used on occasion as a therapy technique, it is rarely conducted in the strict Freudian manner. Other techniques, discussed in Chapter 15, exceed psychoanalysis in effectiveness and popularity among contemporary therapists. Abraham Maslow (1908–1970) contributed a theory of motivation and ideas about exceptional people to the growing humanistic psychology movement. By the 1960s, American psychology was dominated by behaviorism (discussed in a later section of this chapter) on one side and Freud’s theories on the other. Structuralism had fallen into disfavor, and functionalism and Gestalt psychology were no longer distinct schools of thought. Just as other aspects of American culture at this time began to feature rebelliousness against current ways of thinking, some psychologists began to push against the restrictions of psychodynamic theory. Many of these disenchanted psychologists had been trained in psychoanalysis but were not seeing the results they desired. This dissatisfaction with prevailing views led these psychologists to propose new ways of thinking about the human mind through an approach known as humanistic psychologyhumanistic psychologyAn approach that saw people as inherently good and motivated to learn and improve.        humanistic psychology        An approach that saw people as inherently good and motivated to learn and improve.. Freud, James, and the behaviorists all believed that human behavior was on a continuum with animal behavior, which led to their assumption that humans naturally shared the aggressive impulses of animals. For Freud in particular, society had a civilizing function on the otherwise selfish and aggressive human. In contrast, the humanistic psychologists extended the philosophy of Jean-Jacques Rousseau and other 18th-century Romantic philosophers into a belief that people are innately good, are motivated to improve themselves, and behave badly only when corrupted by society. Instead of focusing on what went wrong in people’s lives, humanistic psychologist Abraham Maslow (1908–1970) asked interesting questions about what made a person good. Maslow introduced a major theory of motivation, which is described in more detail in Chapter 7. As Chapter 16 will show, Maslow’s emphasis on what is good about people, as opposed to Freud’s focus on what goes wrong with people, reemerged in the form of contemporary positive psychology. Prior to advances in psychological science, people with psychological disorders were subjected to bizarre treatments, such as this 18th-century spinning device intended to calm patients. Humanistic therapists rebelled against Freudian approaches to treatment. As described in more detail in Chapter 15, one humanistic therapist, Carl Rogers (1902–1987), developed a new approach to therapy called client-centered therapy. In this type of therapy, the people receiving treatment are called clients rather than patients, reflecting their equal standing with the therapist and their active role in the therapy process. Humanistic approaches to therapy have also influenced communication, group process, parenting, and politics. The emphasis on active listening and the use of I hear what you’re saying reflections have become nearly cliché in courses of leadership training and interpersonal communication. Advice to parents to provide unconditional love to their children is a direct application of humanistic beliefs, which are discussed in more detail in Chapter 11. Finally, humanistic psychology continues to flavor our political and social domains. When issues such as capital punishment arise, the humanistic contention that there are no bad people, just bad societies that fail people, typically appears as part of the debate.Beginning at the dawn of the 20th century, the concepts of mental processes and brain function in our definition of psychology took a back seat to observable behavior for the better part of the next 50 years because psychologists following the approach of behaviorismbehaviorismAn approach that features the study and careful measurement of observable behaviors        behaviorism        An approach that features the study and careful measurement of observable behaviors concentrated on observable, measurable behaviors. As part of their effort to measure behavior carefully, many behaviorists restricted their research to studies using animals. Armed with Darwin’s evidence linking humans to animals, the behaviorists comfortably drew parallels between their observations of animals and their assumptions about human behavior. In particular, behaviorists were fascinated by learning, which is examined in depth in Chapter 8. Humanistic therapists, like Carl Rogers (1902–1987), often rebelled against Freudian approaches to therapy. For example, Rogers (in the white shirt leading a group therapy session) referred to people as clients rather than patients, the term that Freud used. Ivan Petrovich Pavlov (1849–1936) had a particularly significant impact on behaviorism and psychology. While studying digestion in dogs, he realized that the dogs’ salivation in response to the arrival of the handler or to being harnessed for an experiment, rather than just to the food itself, indicated that the dogs had associated, or linked, these signals with the arrival of food. The dogs’ ability to use this learned association to anticipate important future events was a remarkable advantage in terms of survival. This type of learning is now called classical or Pavlovian conditioning, which will be covered in detail in Chapter 8. In 1920, Francis Cecil Sumner (1895–1954) became the first African American to receive a doctorate in psychology for his work on psychoanalysis. Sumner’s later work focused on religion and racism. Psychology textbooks would spend little time on Pavlov if his research applied only to salivating dogs. Although classical conditioning occurs in rather primitive organisms, including fruit flies, snails, and slugs, it also occurs quite frequently in humans. Many of our emotional responses associated with environmental cues are the result of this type of learning. If you feel especially anxious prior to taking an exam, you can thank classical conditioning. If you are repulsed by the idea of eating a food that you once consumed just before becoming ill, this is again a likely result of classical conditioning. John B. Watson (1878–1958) began experimenting with learning in rats and independently came to many of the same conclusions as Pavlov. Watson echoed the blank-slate approach of the British empiricist philosophers in his emphasis on the role of experience in forming human behavior. Later in his career, Watson applied his understanding of behavior to the budding American advertising industry. By 1930, he was earning $70,000 per year as an advertising executive—an astronomical salary for the time, much higher than the $3,000 per year he earned as a professor. After discovering that blindfolded participants couldn’t tell the difference between brands of cigarettes, Watson concluded that to be successful, a product must be associated with an appealing image. The advertising industry was never the same, and today’s advertisers continue to apply Watson’s principles. The Freudians and humanistic psychologists had conflicting views on human nature, with the Freudians believing that we are naturally selfish and aggressive and the humanistic psychologists believing that we are naturally good. These philosophical differences continue to color our discussions of topics: Is a criminal a bad person who was never properly socialized or a good person who was corrupted?While studying digestion, Ivan Petrovich Pavlov (1849–1936) realized that his dogs could learn that certain signals meant food was on the way. Watson’s legacy in psychology was enormous. He restricted psychology to the study of observable behavior. As will be established in Chapter 2 and throughout this text, even psychologists who are interested in internal events, like the visual recognition of an object, seek related observable behaviors, such as brain images or reaction time. Like Pavlov, Watson approached psychology with a focus on the relationships between environmental cues and behavior. Other behaviorists were more interested in the effects of consequences on behavior, an idea that was derived from basic functionalism. Edward Thorndike (1874–1949) proposed the law of effect, which suggested that behaviors followed by pleasant or helpful outcomes would be more likely to occur in the future, whereas behaviors followed by unpleasant or harmful outcomes would be less likely to occur. He based his law on observations of cats’ behavior in a puzzle box he had constructed (see Figure 1.5). To escape the box, a cat was required to complete a sequence of behaviors. Through trial-and-error learning, the cat would escape faster and faster on successive trials. In other words, the cat repeated effective behaviors and abandoned ineffective ones. If you own a cat, you probably know that cats don’t like to be enclosed in boxes. Edward Thorndike (1874–1949) studied the escape strategies of a cat to build his law of effect. Like Thorndike, B. F. Skinner (1904–1990) was interested in the effects of consequences on how frequently behaviors were performed. Skinner shared Watson’s belief that psychology did not benefit from consideration of consciousness or internal mental states (see Figure 1.6). He believed that inner, private states such as thinking and feeling existed, but he viewed them as behaviors that followed the same rules as public behaviors, like driving a car (Jensen & Burgess, 1997). He not only reduced his study of behavior to the actions of rats and pigeons in adapted cages that came to be known as Skinner boxes, but he also was comfortable generalizing from the behavior of rats and pigeons to complex human behaviors. Despite its strong focus on a limited set of animals and situations, Skinner’s behaviorism has provided a wealth of beneficial applications. Smokers attempting to quit, doctors and nurses engaging in self-paced continuing education courses, and children receiving treatment for autism spectrum disorder are all likely to be benefiting from Skinner’s efforts. Strict behaviorists often referred to a black box model, in which stimuli enter and responses exit, but you don’t need to know much about what the box is doing to the data. When psychologists began substituting what they learned about the brain for the inner workings of the black box, this led to the development of the biological psychology perspective, also known as behavioral neuroscience. Classical conditioning helps us understand the links that we make between environmental cues and our emotions. If a soldier associated the smell of diesel fuel with traumatic experiences, smelling diesel fuel at a gas station back home could trigger distress. By the 1950s, the behaviorists’ lack of interest in mental states and activity was challenged by scientists from diverse fields, including linguistics and computer science, leading to a cognitive revolution. Cognition covers the private and internal mental processes that the behaviorists avoided studying—information processing, thinking, reasoning, and problem solving. Ulric Neisser (1928–2012) gave the new field its name in his 1967 book, Cognitive Psychology. John B. Watson (left, 1878–1958) was a strong believer in the blank-slate approach of the earlier empiricist philosophers. After working as a psychology professor, he applied his knowledge of human behavior to advertising with great success. Watson believed that a product would sell better if it were paired with an appealing image. His ideas are still used by advertisers today. For instance, an image of Chinese basketball star Yao Ming is being used to sell health insurance in Suzhou, eastern China. Breakthroughs in computer technology allowed these new cognitive psychologists to use mathematical and computer models to illuminate the mental processes leading to observable behaviors. Alan Newell (1927–1992) and Herbert Simon (1916–2001) wrote groundbreaking artificial intelligence programs using human information processing as their model. By the 1980s, most university psychology departments were offering courses in cognition. By the 1990s, collaborations between cognitive and biological psychologists led to the new field of cognitive neuroscience, which seeks to identify brain structures and functions involved in processing information. Chapter 10 will explore the contributions of cognitive psychologists in more detail. B. F. Skinner (1904–1990), shown here with the apparatus that bears his name—the Skinner box, was interested in the effects of reward and punishment on future behavior. Computers were named after the job title of the women who did most computation tasks before the machines were invented, and who continued to operate them. Although these early computers were less powerful than your cell phone (not to mention more expensive), their operation gave psychologists new ideas about how the mind might process information. Ulric Neisser (1928–2012) contributed the term cognition to the emerging field that studied information processing, thinking, reasoning, and problem solving. Foundation of psychologyThings to rememberWilhelm Wundt (1832–1920)StructuralismBehavior can be broken down into its components.

Ulric Neisser (1928–2012)Cognitive revolutionPrivate mental processing can be studied scientifically.William James, the Freudians, and the behaviorists all tried to answer psychological questions with a comprehensive big theory approach. However, it is difficult to build a big theory without a large body of experimental data, and psychology was still a young science. To fill this gap, psychological scientists began to build a database by specializing in more specific points of view, or perspectives. By focusing on one part of the discipline, as opposed to trying to answer everything at once, psychologists began to gain an in-depth understanding of at least one aspect of mind at a time. By the second half of the 20th century, most psychologists were examining psychological phenomena from one of a handful of perspectives. The use of different perspectives does not imply disagreement or conflict. In most cases, the use of each perspective depended on specialized expertise and methods, so different fields of psychology became characterized by their distinct theories and methods. For example, understanding how a child learns a new vocabulary word would be investigated using different theories and methods by the biological, developmental, cognitive, social, or behavioral psychologist. Reflecting the traditional divisions of the field, it is common today for psychologists to refer to themselves as social psychologists, developmental psychologists, and so on, indicating their area of specialization and interest. Psychology departments of universities often continue this organization, and students applying to graduate school in psychology might specialize in one particular area, like choosing an undergraduate major. Biological psychologists explore the relationships among mind, behavior, and their underlying biological processes. They often use technology such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Scott Grafton of the University of California, Santa Barbara, is pointing out the features of the brain of one of the authors of this book.The need to consider major perspectives in psychology was reinforced in a report titled Strengthening the Common Core of the Introductory Psychology Course, published in 2014 by the American Psychological Association (Gurung et al., 2014). We have already seen how the various perspectives might address the question of why some children don’t like broccoli. To further illustrate the distinctions among some of the main perspectives, we will consider how each might approach the question of human memory, discussed in detail in Chapter 9. Biological psychologyBiological psychologyThe psychological perspective that focuses on the relationships between mind and behavior, as well as their underlying biological processes, including genetics, biochemistry, anatomy, and physiology; also known as behavioral neuroscience        Biological psychology        The psychological perspective that focuses on the relationships between mind and behavior, as well as their underlying biological processes, including genetics, biochemistry, anatomy, and physiology; also known as behavioral neuroscience, also called behavioral neuroscience, focuses on the relationships between mind and behavior and their underlying biological processes, including genetics, biochemistry, anatomy, and physiology. In other words, biological psychologists are interested in the physical mechanisms associated with behavior. In addition to the basic behavioral genetics presented in Chapter 3 and the biological psychology presented in Chapter 4, this perspective is emphasized in Chapter 5 (sensation and perception), Chapter 6 (consciousness), and Chapter 7 (motivation and emotion). As Chapter 4 will show, technological advances beginning in the 1970s, especially new methods for observing brain activity, initiated an explosion of knowledge about the connections between brain and behavior. Using these new technologies, biological psychologists have approached the question of storage and retrieval of memories in many ways, ranging from observing changes in communication between nerve cells in slugs to investigating the effects of stress hormones on the ability to form memories. A branch of the biological perspective, evolutionary psychologyevolutionary psychologyA psychological perspective that investigates how physical structure and behavior have been shaped by their contributions to survival and reproduction        evolutionary psychology        A psychological perspective that investigates how physical structure and behavior have been shaped by their contributions to survival and reproduction, attempts to answer the question of how our physical structure and behavior have been shaped by their contributions to our species’ survival. This perspective should sound familiar—it is a modern extension of James’s functionalism, discussed previously in this chapter. Earlier, we also saw evolutionary psychology at work in the shaping of our sensitivity to bitter tastes. The basic principle of evolutionary psychology is that our current behavior exists in its present form because it provided some advantage in survival and reproduction to our ancestors. An evolutionary psychologist might be interested in our good memory for faces, and particularly for faces of people who have cheated us in the past (Barclay & Lalumière, 2006). In the world of the hunter–gatherer, being cheated out of a fair share of the hunt was likely to lead to starvation for a family, and people who could not keep track of the cheaters were unlikely to survive and reproduce. Evolutionary psychologists are interested in how our modern behaviors are shaped by our species’ history. Cognitive psychologyCognitive psychologyA psychological perspective that investigates information processing, thinking, reasoning, and problem solving        Cognitive psychology        A psychological perspective that investigates information processing, thinking, reasoning, and problem solving focuses on the process of thinking, or the processing of information. Because our ability to remember plays an integral part in the processing of information, a cognitive psychologist is likely to have a lot to say about the storage and retrieval of memories. A cognitive psychologist might ask why processing seems different when we are trying to remember names and dates while taking a history test compared to remembering how to ride a bicycle. What processes lead to the frustrating experience of having something on the tip of your tongue, in which you remember the first letter or a part of a word you’re trying to retrieve, but not the whole thing? What strategies can we use to make our memories more efficient? These and similar issues are addressed in Chapters 9 and 10. Developmental psychologyDevelopmental psychologyA psychological perspective that examines the normal changes in behavior that occur across the life span.        Developmental psychology        A psychological perspective that examines the normal changes in behavior that occur across the life span. explores the normal changes in behavior that occur across the life span. Using the developmental perspective, a psychologist might look at how memory functions in people of different ages. Without further practice, 3-month-old babies can retain for about a month the memory that kicking moves a mobile suspended above their crib (Rovee-Collier, 1997). However, most adults have difficulty recalling events that occurred before the age of 3 or 4 years. Teens and young adults are able to remember names faster than are older adults (Bashore, Ridderinkhof, & van der Molen, 1997). These and other age-related changes are explored in Chapter 11. Cognitive psychologists investigate the ways that the human mind processes information. This cognitive psychologist is studying the use of mirrored images to help individuals overcome phantom pain due to the loss of a limb. Seeing images of what appears to be a healthy limb in place of the missing limb changes the way the mind thinks about the missing limb, leading to a reduction in perceived pain. Social and personality psychology describes the effects of the social environment, including social and cultural diversitycultural diversityVariations in the practices, values, and goals shared by groups of people        cultural diversity        Variations in the practices, values, and goals shared by groups of people, and individual differences on the behavior of individuals (see Figure 1.8). Social and personality psychologists recognize that we construct our own realities and that the social environment influences our thoughts, feelings, and behavior. Early psychologists were limited in their understanding of mind by their exclusive focus on their own sociocultural contexts. More recently, social psychologists have emphasized the need to explore the influences of sociocultural context and biology on our behavior. Returning to our memory example, the social psychologist might ask how being in the presence of others influences the storage and retrieval of data. When we are sitting comfortably in our own homes, the answers to Jeopardy! questions come relatively easily. In front of millions of viewers, however, we might be lucky to remember our own names. The emergence of social media has provided social and personality psychologists with new methods for examining the social mind and individual differences. What do your updates say about your personality? When the updates of more than 70,000 people who completed a Facebook personality test were examined, clear differences in their choices of words were observed. (Data from  Park et al., 2015.)Developmental psychologists look at the behavior that is typical for people of certain ages, from infancy to old age. The amount of time this infant spends looking at moving stick figures helps us understand at what point in life we perceive biological motion. Although much of psychology explores how the average person thinks, feels, or acts, some people are not average. Behavior can vary dramatically from one individual to another as a function of personality factors and many aspects of diversity, including age, gender and gender identity, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, disability status, and socioeconomic status. Using our example of memory, we can see how individual differences in need for cognition can predict memory for verbal material (Cacioppo, Petty, Feinstein, & Jarvis, 1996). People who have a high need for cognition enjoy mental challenges, like solving difficult puzzles. As Chapter 13 will explore, individuals who are high in need for cognition also remember more of the messages to which they are exposed and respond differently to persuasive messages. Finally, the clinical psychologyclinical psychologyA psychological perspective that seeks to explain, define, and treat abnormal behaviors        clinical psychology        A psychological perspective that seeks to explain, define, and treat abnormal behaviors perspective seeks to explain, define, and treat psychological disorders, as explained in detail in Chapters 14 and 15. More recently, the clinical perspective has expanded to include the promotion of general well-being and health, which is described in Chapter 16. Many types of psychological disorders affect memory. Freud believed that traumatizing experiences were more difficult to remember, a process that he labeled repression (which will be discussed later, in Chapters 9 and 14). In other cases, war veterans and others who have experienced trauma might be troubled by memories that are too good, producing intrusive flashback memories of disturbing events. Social psychologists explore the effects of the social environment on our individual behavior. In this example, the man in the middle is deciding whether to conform with the other two men in a simple judgment of line length.Although the 20th-century perspective approach to psychology generated detailed understanding of aspects of behavior and mental processes, it has become apparent that single perspectives are insufficient for fully describing and explaining psychological phenomena. Armed with in-depth research results compiled from these various perspectives, many psychological scientists in the 21st century have returned to the more comprehensive view of the mind envisioned more than 100 years ago by James (Cacioppo, 2013). Their questions and methods are more likely to blur the lines of the perspectives outlined earlier, often with remarkable results. For example, a full understanding of romantic relationships is more likely to emerge from combinations of perspectives than through the use of single perspectives. Zooming out to combine an understanding of cultural and social contexts, biological factors (such as the bonding hormone oxytocin), personality (individual traits), social experience (such as self-fulfilling prophesies), cognitions (such as automatic thought), and the effects of psychological disorders (as in borderline personality disorder) give us a more comprehensive view of the phenomenon. (see Figure 1.9). What accounts for our romantic attraction to that special someone? Single perspectives provide considerable insight, but combining perspectives gives us a richer understanding of human behavior. In addition to the five psychological perspectives reviewed in this chapter, a more general perspective provided by culture and diversity is also essential to our understanding of behavior. The guidelines proposed for the introductory psychology course by Gurung et al. (2014) emphasize the need to use culture and diversity as a cross-cutting theme. In accordance with this view, each of the editions of this textbook has been crafted following the guidance provided by Trimble, Stevenson, and Worell (2003) about integrating issues of diversity into all relevant discussions in an organic way. In addition to incorporating diversity seamlessly throughout our topics, we also believe that it is useful to provide opportunities to highlight diversity issues in greater depth, which is the purpose of having this feature in each chapter. As suggested by Betancourt and López (1993, p. 636), psychology as a discipline will benefit both from efforts to infuse culture in mainstream research and theory and from efforts to study culture and develop theory in cross-cultural and ethnic psychology. This first chapter has reviewed psychology’s historical timeline and explored some of the career paths that psychologists can follow. From a diversity perspective, we see that the history of psychology features a dramatic underrepresentation of ethnic and racial minorities and a very short timeline. Stanley  Sue (2009) noted that it wasn’t until 1975 that the first African-American woman was licensed as a psychologist (Gail Wyatt) in the state of California. Sue himself was told that in 1971, he was the only Chinese-American with a regular faculty appointment in an American Psychological Association–accredited clinical psychology program in the entire nation. As Sue and others have pointed out, underrepresentation has negative consequences both for psychologists themselves and for the people they serve as teachers, researchers, or therapists. Recognition of the problem has led to remedial efforts, but there is still a long way to go. Kenneth and Mamie Clark conducted some of the most famous experiments in psychology in 1939–1940. Children in segregated schools were shown two dolls that were identical except for hair, eye, and skin color, and asked questions such as whether one doll was nicer, or if the child would prefer to play with one doll over the other. The majority of children, regardless of their own race, preferred the white doll. The Clarks not only made Contributions to our understanding of the social context of child development, but their research was applied as evidence in hearings by the U. S. Supreme Court on the detrimental effects of segregated schools. In 2005, an 18-year-old high school student, Kiri Davis, repeated the Clark’s doll study for her film A Girl Like Me: The Gwen Araujo Story. She found that 15 out of 21 African-American girls still preferred the white doll. Psychology, of course, is not alone in facing this problem, but as students of the mind, we must include diverse viewpoints to ensure accuracy. In Chapter 5, you will read about how white Americans and Asians respond differently to objects (a tiger) and backgrounds (a jungle) in a photograph. If we studied only one of these groups, we would end up with faulty conclusions. Clinical psychologists seek to understand and treat psychological disorders. We don’t have a crystal ball that will allow us to foresee psychology’s future. However, we strongly believe that this future will involve combining and integrating new and existing perspectives. Many of these new ways of looking at the mind will take advantage of the revolution in techniques for studying the brain that began in the 1970s and continues. Already, today’s cognitive neuroscientists investigate the brain as an information-processing system and search for the biological basis of topics such as attention, decision making, and memory. Social neuroscientists investigate the biological factors that vary with people’s feelings and experiences of social inclusion, rejection, or loneliness. Behavioral neuroscientists pick up previous lines of research on learning, memory, motivation, and sleep, and search for connections between these processes and our biology. Clinical and counseling psychologists are likely to consider biological processes in their theories about the causes of psychological disorders. By merging the five perspectives of mind, we stand a better chance of tackling the remarkable problem of understanding the human mind (see Figure 1.10). Viewing the mind by zooming in and using specialized perspectives has led to significant increases in our understanding, but 21st-century psychology is characterized by efforts to zoom out and integrate multiple, cross-cutting perspectives. We have argued that restricting our thinking about an aspect of mind to the information provided by one perspective can result in an incomplete picture, but can this single-perspective approach actually lead us in the wrong direction?The answer to that question is a resounding yes. Consider the following example. For many years, researchers were puzzled in their efforts to understand the relationships between child maltreatment and later antisocial behavior. Although maltreatment often seems to be linked to later criminal behavior, the majority of maltreated children do not become delinquents or adult criminals (Caspi et al., 2002). To solve this dilemma, a clinical psychologist might focus on environmental factors, such as the presence of a trusted adult or delinquent peer group, or personal factors, like resilience. Working in parallel, biological psychologists know something about certain candidate genes and their relationships with aggressive behavior in animals. In particular, animals with a low-activity version of the MAOA gene seemed to be more aggressive than animals with a higher-activity version. However, links between variations in MAOA and human aggression are not clear. Experiencing childhood maltreatment does not reliably predict aggressiveness in youth, but combining genetics and exposure to maltreatment provides a clearer picture. Separately, neither group of psychologists is likely to do a very good job of explaining why some children exposed to maltreatment engage in antisocial behavior while others do not. The solution, however, becomes apparent when we combine the clinical psychologists’ observations of environmental factors with the genetic information provided by the biological psychologists. It appears that a gene-environment interaction takes place, in which children with the low-activity version of the MAOA gene responded to maltreatment by becoming antisocial, while children with the higher-activity version do not (Caspi et al., 2002;  Fergusson, Boden, Horwood, Miller, & Kennedy, 2011). Restricting ourselves to one perspective might cloud our understanding, but combining perspectives leads us to an accurate conclusion.In 2013–2014, 117,000 students in the United States received a bachelor’s degree in psychology (U. S. Department of Education, 2016). This amounts to approximately 6% of the 1.9 million bachelor’s degrees awarded that year, making psychology the fourth-most-frequent bachelor’s degree program (following business, the health professions, and combined social sciences and history). What are these psychology graduates likely to be doing in the workforce?Forensic psychologists attempt to understand the criminal mind and to develop effective treatments for criminal behavior. Psychology is unlike some other disciplines in which people with a bachelor’s degree can refer to themselves as a practicing member of the relevant profession, such as a chemist or biologist. Calling oneself a psychologist is restricted to holders of graduate (usually doctorate) degrees. This does not mean that students who completed a bachelor’s degree in psychology cannot be employed in relevant fields. Some people with undergraduate degrees in psychology prefer employment in fields that are directly related to psychology, such as working in research facilities or rehabilitation centers for drug abuse or brain damage. Others are quite successful in a variety of people-oriented jobs, such as those found in management, sales, customer service, public affairs, education, human resources, probation, and journalism. This diversity of career pathways reflects the hub nature of psychology to other fields, as described earlier in this chapter. More than half of people holding graduate degrees in psychology work in health care, counseling, financial services, or legal services professions (Stamm, Lin, & Christidis, 2016). Graduates with a master’s degree in psychology, usually requiring 1 to 2 years of additional study past the bachelor’s degree, can teach at the community college (2-year) level and obtain licensing as therapists in most states, as discussed further in Chapter 15. School psychologists with a master’s degree typically work on elementary, middle school, or high school campuses. These psychologists participate in academic and career counseling, as well as the identification and remediation of problems that interfere with student success. Sports psychologist Julie Elion gives Phil Mickelson some final tips during his preparation for an important PGA championship. Many people working in psychology have earned doctoral degrees, which usually take 2 to 5 years of study beyond the master’s level. As shown in Figure 1.11, about 34% of new doctoral-level psychologists do what your professor and the authors of this textbook do: teach, conduct research at colleges and universities, or both. About 45% of new doctoral-level psychologists work as therapists. Smaller numbers of new doctoral-level psychologists find employment in business and government settings, elementary and secondary schools, and other related fields. Most psychologists with graduate degrees are employed in clinical and higher-education settings, but opportunities for students of psychology also exist in schools, businesses, government, and other places in which an understanding of human behavior is helpful. Psychologists entering doctoral programs traditionally identify with one of the major perspectives discussed earlier, such as social, cognitive, or biological. Choosing a graduate perspective is similar to choosing an undergraduate major. Although all psychology graduate students might take core courses in research methods and statistics, they typically pursue coursework and research in their particular area of specialization. However, training of psychologists in the 21st century is beginning to reflect the connections occurring in the field. Increasingly, students are being trained in combined specialties (e.g., cognitive neuroscience) as psychology becomes an increasingly integrated field of study. The most rigid distinction occurs between graduate students who plan to specialize in clinical or counseling psychology and those who do not. The clinical or counseling track includes extensive internships and supervised training prior to government-regulated licensure that usually add at least 1 year to students’ graduate studies. Do not assume that your psychology professors are all therapists; it is most likely they are not. It is important to distinguish between therapists with doctoral degrees in psychology (PhDs or PsyDs) and psychiatrists, who are medical doctors (MDs). The biggest difference between the two professions is that psychiatrists can prescribe medication, but psychologists usually cannot. In New Mexico, Louisiana, Illinois, Iowa, and Idaho however, specially trained psychologists can legally prescribe medications, and this trend might spread to other states. In Chapter 15, we will provide more detail about the types of therapists who treat adjustment problems and psychological disorders. We gave quite a lot of thought to how we might help you, the students reading our book, to see psychology more as an interconnected discipline than as a collection of separate perspectives. The introductory psychology course provides a unique opportunity to see all perspectives at one time, in contrast to upper-division courses, which typically focus on one specialty at a time (biological, developmental, social, cognitive, clinical, and so on). At the beginning of each chapter, we will take a question relevant to the chapter, such as Why are we sensitive to bitter tastes? and explore it using multiple perspectives. At the end of each chapter, we’ll mirror this process by taking a single problem and seeing how the material in the chapter can be applied. This feature of the textbook will have more of a perspective flavor than the beginnings of each chapter, but by the end of the textbook, you will have seen how each of the major perspectives in psychological science contributes to the whole picture. Because it is most helpful to know something about the perspectives before you see how they can be applied, we save this feature for the end of each chapter. Ideally, seeing the chapter material in action will make it more memorable for you. The single problem we have chosen to consider this way is one that we know to be on the minds of many of our students: their relationships with others. We are a social species, and the quality of our relationships has a huge impact on our physical and psychological well-being (Cacioppo & Hawkley, 2009). We will see how each of the major perspectives views the question of relationship quality and how the perspectives work together to give us the best possible understanding of this important aspect of life. As you have seen in this chapter, psychological science is the study of behavior, mental processes, and brain functions. As such, psychology has much to say about the causes and solutions of contemporary human problems. To illustrate psychology’s power to contribute to the understanding and solution of these problems, each chapter will focus on a big problem from the point of view of the chapter content. While each chapter addresses only a part of the problem, by the time you reach the end of the textbook, you will have been exposed to many ways that psychology can contribute to solving some of the biggest challenges that human beings face today, such as pollution, climate change, education, poverty, terrorism, pandemics, food insecurity, crime, and social injustice. Solving such big problems might seem overwhelming, but by breaking each problem into little steps, real progress can be made. We’d like to model this process for you by tackling a single problem, but we encourage you to expand on our model by applying what you’ve learned to other issues that you find important. The problem we’ll address is cyberbullying, or the use of electronic technology to bully another person. Bullying, in turn, is defined as aggressive, repeated behavior that involves a real or perceived power imbalance. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that in 2015, nearly one out of every six high school students experienced cyberbullying in the previous 12 months (Kann et al., 2016). Outcomes for the individuals involved included depression, anxiety, health problems, academic problems, and even suicide. In the upcoming chapters, we want you to think about how the different perspectives might view both the causes and solutions to our problem. What research results and other information do you need to understand the problem better? Do ethical concerns and issues of diversity influence the causes and solutions of the problem? How would our lives be affected if the problem continues to worsen or if solutions actually can be found? PerspectiveThings to rememberBiological and evolutionary psychologyInvestigates the connections among mind, behavior, and biological processes, and asks how our evolutionary past continues to shape our behaviorCognitive psychologyInvestigates mental processes, including thinking, problem solving, and information processingSocial and personality psychologyAsks how our behavior is affected by the presence of others; Recognizes that behavior varies around averages and that individual differences often interact with environmentsDevelopmental psychologyInvestigates the normal changes in behavior that occur across the life spanClinical psychologyExplains, defines, and treats psychological disorders and promotes general well-being`;
