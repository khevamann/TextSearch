export const text = `Different versions of the serotonin transporter gene are not equally distributed throughout the world. Although you might be comfortable with the idea that a trait like a moth’s color can make it better adapted to one environment over another, how do you feel about your personality as an adaptation? Are there some types of personalities that thrive in some circumstances better than others? Can a culture shape personality? Can the personalities of a group of people shape their culture?In Chapter 3, we introduced you to the serotonin transporter gene, which can come in two versions or alleles: Short (S) and long (L). Children with two short alleles (SS) were more likely than children with either a combination of alleles (SL) or two long alleles (LL) to react negatively to the experience of being bullied frequently (Sugden et al., 2010). Zooming out to the map of the world, you can see that these genotypes are not equally distributed worldwide. Yellow areas on the map have low frequencies of the S allele, and orange and red areas have higher frequencies. South Africa has a relatively small number of people with the S allele (28%) compared to the United States, Australia, and Great Britain (about 40 to 45%), which in turn have many fewer than China (about 80%). Besides having different distributions of the serotonin transporter gene alleles, what else do you know about these cultures? If you thought about these cultures as differing in individualism versus collectivism, you are correct. Although some cultures with lower frequencies of the S allele have more collectivistic cultures than the United States, there is a positive correlation between the percentage of S allele carriers and a culture’s rating on a scale from individualistic to collectivistic (Chiao & Blizinsky, 2010). Why would this be the case? Like all correlations, multiple relationships among genetic profiles and culture ratings are possible, and we cannot make conclusions about causes for these relationships. A population with a certain genetic mix might be more likely to form a particular type of culture, a culture might shape the reproductive success of its members, some outside variable could influence both the genetic mix and the form of the culture, or some combination of these factors could influence one another simultaneously (see Figure 12.1). Asians have a much higher probability of having the S allele of the serotonin transporter gene than do people living in many other parts of the world. The percentage of people carrying the S allele varies according to a culture’s position on the continuum from individualism to collectivism. Only about 40% of people in highly individualistic cultures such as the United States, Australia, and the United Kingdom carry the S allele, compared to nearly 80% in highly collectivistic cultures such as China, Japan, and Korea. Zooming in to the level of the individual, we find that people carrying the S allele are especially attentive to negative information, such as words and pictures that produce negative emotions (Beevers, Gibb, McGeary, & Miller, 2007;  Osinsky et al., 2008). This focus on negativity might help people in collectivistic environments because it could lead to a heightened sensitivity to another person’s anger or fear. Early recognition of impending negative interactions might give people a chance to smooth things over before they escalate. The L allele, however, is associated with reduced responses to psychological and social sources of stress (Nardi et al., 2013), which might enhance coping in the individualistic environment. The person carrying the S allele might be too cautious for the individualistic cultural environment, whereas the person carrying the L allele might act like a bull in a china cabinet in the collectivistic environment (see Figure 12.2). The serotonin transporter gene comes in two versions or alleles. People with a copy of the short (S) allele tend to be more anxious and cautious, whereas people with a copy of the long (L) allele are prone to greater risk taking and creativity. Although the S allele is a risk factor for depression (see Chapter 14), China has a lower rate of depression than the United States despite the higher frequency of the S allele in the Chinese population (Chiao & Blizinsky, 2010). The collectivistic environment might buffer an individual with the S allele from the stress that can lead to depression. As you will see in this chapter, individual differences are an important aspect of behavior and mental processing, but they must be viewed within the larger contexts of the social and cultural environment.Suppose that you were given the following feedback about your personality (Forer, 1949, p. 120):You have a need for other people to like and admire you, and yet you tend to be critical of yourself. Although you have some weaknesses, you are generally able to compensate for them. You have considerable unused capacity that you have not turned to your advantage, however. Disciplined and self-controlled on the outside, you tend to be worrisome and insecure on the inside. At times, you have serious doubts as to whether you have made the right decision or done the right thing. You prefer a certain amount of change and variety and become dissatisfied when hemmed in by restrictions and limitations. You also pride yourself as an independent thinker and do not accept other’s statements without satisfactory proof. But you have found it unwise to be too frank in revealing yourself to others. How well does this description fit your beliefs about your personality? You might be impressed by how this paragraph presents such specific and personalized information about you. Ironically, you probably relate to this description because it applies to nearly everyone. So, the question is: If our personalities are so unique, how can we all be so easily described in a few brief sentences?The science of personality explores characteristic patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving. To what extent is a person’s personality truly unique, and to what extent is personality based on general characteristics that describe nearly everyone? How consistent is our behavior across time and across situations? How much of a role does biology or experience play in developing our personalities? Is the basic nature of humans good or bad?Personality is our characteristic way of thinking, feeling, and behaving. How unique are we? How much do our personalities overlap with the personalities of other people?Personality theories represent far more than simple curiosity about human behavior. These theories are intimately bound to our views of normal and abnormal behavior, which we will discuss in Chapter 14. Many of the psychologists who proposed personality theories also contributed influential ideas to the treatment of psychological disorders.The study of personality for the first half of the 20th century was dominated by the psychodynamic approaches of Sigmund Freud and his followers. Behaviorists such as B. F. Skinner attempted to apply principles of learning to personality. The humanistic psychologists, including Carl Rogers, actively rebelled against Freud’s psychodynamic approach. While few contemporary psychologists adhere to these historical approaches to personality, these theories stimulated interest in individual differences.The term psychodynamicpsychodynamicA theory put forward by Sigmund Freud in which psychic energy moves among the compartments of the personality: Id, ego, and superego.            psychodynamic        A theory put forward by Sigmund Freud in which psychic energy moves among the compartments of the personality: Id, ego, and superego.             was first used by Ernst von Brücke in 1874 (Hall, 1954). Von Brücke used the term as an extension of the first law of thermodynamics, which states that energy in a closed system can change from one form to another but cannot be created or destroyed. You may not have heard of von Brücke before, but you are likely familiar with one of his students, Freud, who made psychodynamics the foundation of his theory of personality. As a young physician, Freud became famous for his success in treating patients with hysteria, a condition characterized by physical symptoms without medical cause that is known today as somatic symptom disorder (see Chapter 14). Freud sought to incorporate his observations of his patients into a new, unifying theory of psychology. His treatment approach, which we cover in Chapter 15, was known as psychoanalysispsychoanalysisSigmund Freud’s treatment approach based on his psychodynamic theory            psychoanalysis        Sigmund Freud’s treatment approach based on his psychodynamic theory            . Personality was viewed by Freud as a closed energy system, in which psychic or instinctive energy moves among three compartments: Id, ego, and superego (see Figure 12.3). Freud proposed that the ididThe component of Sigmund Freud’s personality theory containing primitive drives present at birth            id        The component of Sigmund Freud’s personality theory containing primitive drives present at birth            , which literally means it in Latin, is present at birth and contains the primitive drives that serve as a source of energy for the personality, such as hunger, thirst, and sex. Freud believed that the id operates according to the pleasure principle, seeking immediate gratification and relief. As a child begins to interact with parents and other social influences, the ego and the superego begin to control the id. The egoegoThe component of Sigmund Freud’s personality theory that is the self that others see            ego        The component of Sigmund Freud’s personality theory that is the self that others see             is the component of the personality that is readily seen by others, so it acts as the person’s self. Its task is to coordinate the needs of the id with reality. The superegosuperegoThe component of Sigmund Freud’s personality theory that internalizes society’s rules for right and wrong, or the conscience            superego        The component of Sigmund Freud’s personality theory that internalizes society’s rules for right and wrong, or the conscience             develops when a child begins to internalize society’s rules for right and wrong, forming what we normally refer to as a conscience. As shown in Figure 12.4, we are not conscious of the operations of the id, although we might become consciously aware of the operations of the ego and superego. Sigmund Freud viewed the mind as a closed system in which energy flows from one compartment to the next. It is the job of the ego, or self, to balance the pleasure-seeking impulses of the id with the morality imposed by the superego. Imbalances can be the source of unhealthy behavior. An overly dominant id can lead to antisocial behavior, and an overactive superego might produce too much guilt. According to Freud, we are consciously aware of only a small percentage of the mind’s activities. Some information is located in the preconscious mind and can become conscious at any moment. Information in the unconscious mind can affect our behavior without our awareness. Threats to the balance of the id, ego, and superego can result in anxiety or the sense that danger is around the corner. When the ego is faced with anxiety, it engages in a variety of protective behaviors called defense mechanismsdefense mechanismsIn Sigmund Freud’s personality theory, a protective behavior that reduces anxiety.            defense mechanisms        In Sigmund Freud’s personality theory, a protective behavior that reduces anxiety.            . According to Freud, each of these mechanisms helps us channel potentially self-destructive or painful psychic energy into more constructive or manageable behaviors. For example, when we use the defense mechanism of sublimation, we redirect negative energy. An aggressive teen might take up martial arts rather than starting fights at school. Freud noted, though, that each mechanism has its limits; if people continually use defense mechanisms, they risk doing damage to the ego or self as well. For Freud, the development of the personality is critical to the remainder of his theories and to the therapeutic process of psychoanalysis. Freud assumed that the origins of his patients’ problems could be found in their developmental past, not in their present circumstances. As the word psychosexual implies, Freud was interested in how the developing personality would deal with the sexual impulses of the id. Freud proposed five psychosexual stagespsychosexual stagesA stage in Sigmund Freud’s theory of the developing personality.            psychosexual stages        A stage in Sigmund Freud’s theory of the developing personality.             of personality development: Oral, anal, phallic, latency, and genital. Personality, according to Freud, is the product of conflict occurring during these psychosexual stages. Personality characteristics emerge as the id, ego, and superego resolve their conflicts and struggle for balance. Should the conflict become so great as to produce a clash between ego and reality, psychosis (including abnormal behaviors characteristic of schizophrenia and other serious disorders) might occur (Freud, 1938). Although there is no question regarding the tremendous influence Freud has had on modern thinking, his legacy today is considered mixed. Freud’s approach to development contrasts sharply with the scientific theories of development we explored in Chapter 11, but his work remains important in that it had such a profound influence in psychology and popular culture. Sigmund Freud has become a mainstay in popular culture. A few Freudian constructs appear to be supported by scientific investigation, even though the theoretical mechanisms he proposed have been refuted. The notion of defense mechanisms, the distinction between conscious and unconscious processes, and the descriptions of some types of adult personalities remain topics of research in psychological science (Kline, 2013). However, contemporary scientists point out that Freud’s ideas rarely lend themselves to scientific investigation. Some of his ideas, such as women’s penis envy, are viewed today as remarkably sexist (Sprengnether, 1990). Additional criticisms center on the questionable effectiveness of psychoanalysis, which we discuss in more detail in Chapter 15. No theory as influential as Freud’s is likely to be left alone without revision. Several of Freud’s followers built on his approach to construct their own psychodynamic theories. We refer to these as neo or new Freudians. A common feature of the neo-Freudianneo-FreudianA theorist who attempted to update and modify Sigmund Freud’s original theory of personality.            neo-Freudian        A theorist who attempted to update and modify Sigmund Freud’s original theory of personality.             theories was a substitution of social competence for sexuality and pleasure as the major motivation for human behavior. These theorists brought the psychodynamic approach closer to contemporary views of humans as social animals, a theme we discuss throughout this textbook. Unfortunately, neo-Freudian theories share one of Freud’s greatest weaknesses—the proposal of constructs that do not lend themselves to scientific investigation. We will highlight a few of the notable contributions of this group. Alfred Adler (1870–1937) contributed the notion of an inferiority complex to psychodynamic thought. According to  Adler (1956), an inferiority complex or overwhelming feelings of inferiority can lead to overcompensation, usually in the form of seeking the appearance of superiority rather than the substance. For example, a person might overcompensate for feelings of inferiority by purchasing a fancy, expensive automobile. Adler was also one of the first psychologists to suggest that siblings, along with parents, influence development, leading to investigations of the effects of birth order. Contemporary research, however, casts serious doubt onto the existence of any birth order effects on personality or intelligence (Damian & Roberts, 2015). Carl Jung (1875–1961), a Swiss psychiatrist, divided the unconscious mindunconscious mindThe part of mental activity that cannot be voluntarily retrieved.            unconscious mind        The part of mental activity that cannot be voluntarily retrieved.             into two components. The personal unconscious remained the same as Freud’s unconscious mind. Jung added a deeper level, the collective unconscious, composed of our common psychological predispositions as humans passed from generation to generation (Jung, 1928). After observing common themes in cultures around the world during his extensive travels, Jung argued that generations of experience with concepts such as darkness, power, death, and parents would lead to characteristic ways of unconsciously thinking about such topics. Jung’s ideas are echoed in today’s evolutionary approach to psychology, which views the mind as having adapted over the course of evolution (Walters, 1994). This Tibetan mandala represents unity formed out of the four elements of earth, wind, water, and fire, a theme that Carl Jung believed was universal in the human collective unconscious. In addition to his expansion of the concept of the unconscious, Jung deviated from Freud by providing more specific information about differences in individual personality. In particular, Jung’s concepts of the personality characteristics of extroversion (outgoing) and introversion (relatively less outgoing) are still very much alive in current discussions of personality. Jung’s personality characteristics form the basis for several popular personality tests, such as the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). Unfortunately, as we will see later, the MBTI does not hold up well to analyses of validity and reliability. Karen Horney (1885–1952) was one of the first female psychiatrists. Horney rejected many of Freud’s ideas to concentrate on aspects of culture that contribute to women’s feelings of inferiority. Simultaneously, while treating male patients, Horney became convinced that men envied women’s ability to become pregnant and be mothers. Her emphasis on the impact of a male-dominated society on women helped set the stage for many subsequent feminist scholars (Horney, 1923–1937/1967, 1950). Karen Horney (1885–1952) was one of the first female psychiatrists, and although she is considered a neo-Freudian, she rejected many of Sigmund Freud’s ideas to concentrate on the sources of women’s feelings of inferiority. Alfred Adler suggested that an inferiority complex can lead to overcompensation in the form of seeking the appearance of superiority. Man heels that add at least 2 inches of height have become increasingly popular and are worn frequently by Hollywood stars.Behaviorist approaches to personality emphasized learning as an important influence on personality development. Because learning is a lifetime process, behaviorists expected to see change in personalities over time. According to B. F. Skinner, the principles of operant conditioning, discussed in Chapter 8, would lead to the development of stable response tendencies that might appear to others as traits. For example, if your parents were strict about enforcing rules at home, such as finishing chores, you might look like a conscientious person who always finishes assigned tasks on time. Compared to stable personality traits, Skinner’s response tendencies were more flexible and subject to change. If people experienced something new, their ways of responding would change to reflect that new interaction with the environment. If you move away from home to college, and you no longer have your parents to reward or punish you based on your completion of tasks, you may not be conscientious about finishing your homework on time.Until the 1960s, American psychology was dominated by two perspectives: Behaviorism and the psychodynamic approach. At that time, some psychologists began to consider other ways of approaching psychology in general and in personality specifically. One alternative approach, initially called third-force psychology (behaviorism and psychodynamic theory were forces one and two), later became known as humanistic psychology. Humanistic psychology differed from behaviorism and the psychodynamic approach in several ways. Humanistic psychologists were convinced that humans are unique, and they argued that the animal research favored by behaviorists was irrelevant. The humanistic psychologists’ belief that human nature is basically good contrasts dramatically with the darker view of human nature put forward by Freud and other psychodynamic theorists. Humanistic psychologists believed that psychodynamic theories placed too much emphasis on abnormal behavior. Instead, they advocated studying exceptional people to see why they succeeded, a tactic continued by contemporary positive psychology approaches, discussed in Chapter 16. One of the leading humanistic psychologists, Abraham Maslow, was interested in motivation, and we discussed his contributions to this area in Chapter 7. He did not attempt a full-fledged theory of personality, although he made some interesting conclusions about the characteristics of exceptional people. After reviewing biographies of people such as Albert Einstein, Jane Addams, William James, and Abraham Lincoln,  Maslow (1950) observed that exceptional people shared a number of common traits. In addition to expected characteristics, such as creativity, realistic thinking, and concern for others, Maslow’s exceptional people had some surprising qualities. They had few friends, well-developed senses of humor, and periodic mystic or peak experiences. Carl Rogers (1951, 1980), another humanistic psychologist, put forward a theory of personality based on his experience as a therapist. We discuss Rogers’s approach to therapy in Chapter 15. Rogers, like Maslow, believed that humans strive toward self-actualization or maximizing their individual potential. For Rogers, people who follow the path laid out by their feelings will lead productive, healthy lives. They will experience congruence, or similarity, between their real selves and their ideal selves. Congruence is most likely to occur in response to unconditional positive regard, or a nonjudgmental appreciation for a person’s true nature. Being treated judgmentally makes people act in ways that are incongruent or inconsistent with their ideal selves, which might lead to disordered behaviors (see Figure 12.5). Rogers, like other humanistic psychologists, believed that people were striving for self-actualization or the ability to maximize their potential. Achieving that goal depended on the response of other people (family, friends, and society) to the self. If people receive unconditional positive regard or nonjudgmental acceptance, they can reach self-actualization. However, if their acceptance is conditional on whether they please others, the result is self-discrepancies that can lead to depression, anxiety, and other negative outcomes. Source: Adapted from D. A.  Bernstein (2011). Essentials of Psychology, 5th ed. Belmont, CA: Cengage. As was also the case in psychodynamic theories, it is difficult to move from the humanistic psychologists’ description of personality to our definition of personality as characteristic ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving. The humanistic psychologists are more interested in the process by which personality develops than in the actual characteristics that emerge. Like the psychodynamic theories they rejected, the humanistic psychologists are subject to criticisms of being unscientific in their methods (Child, 1973).

A traittraitA stable personality characteristic.            trait        A stable personality characteristic.             is a stable personality characteristic. Psychologists were hard at work testing personality traits long before they derived coherent theories to explain their findings. They realized intuitively that traits clustered together. An outgoing person might also be expected to be brave and cheerful. However, these approaches lacked the precision required by a true theory of personality. Statistical methods of correlation and factor analysis came to the rescue (see Figure 12.6). As we discussed in Chapter 2, correlations allow us to see whether two variables have some systematic relationship with each other, such as height and weight. Factor analysis allows a researcher to compare large numbers of correlations simultaneously, which makes the technique perfectly suited to the study of clustered personality traits (Spearman, 1904). The statistical technique of factor analysis allows psychologists to identify factors that positively correlate or cluster together, as well as the strengths of those relationships. Raymond Cattell identified 16 personality factors that formed five clusters (extroversion, anxiety, self-control, independence, and receptivity) that are similar to the factors in the Big Five theory proposed later by McCrae and Costa (1985). The darker lines represent stronger statistical relationships.One of the earliest efforts to identify personality traits began with the selection of 4,500 words that described observable traits out of a dictionary (Allport & Odbert, 1936). Some of these terms were defined as central traits, or characteristics that most clearly define and differentiate a person (Allport, 1937). These are the terms you might use when trying to describe someone you know: smart, hardworking, and outgoing. Emerging computer technologies in the 1940s allowed psychologists to refine lists of traits further (Cattell, 1946/1969). Using factor analysis, Allport and Odbert’s original list of 4,500 words was reduced to 16 major personality traits. Each trait took the form of a continuum between opposites. For example, the trait of suspiciousness would range from trusting at one extreme to suspicious at the other. The basic methods and elements for trait theories were now in place.A common theme found in the work of early trait theorists is that relatively few traits are required to describe and predict an individual’s behavior accurately. Based on this work, a Big Five theoryBig Five theoryA trait theory that identifies five main characteristics that account for most individual differences in personality            Big Five theory        A trait theory that identifies five main characteristics that account for most individual differences in personality             identified five core traits: Openness to experience, conscientiousness, surgency (extroversion), agreeableness, and neuroticism (McCrae & Costa, 1985,  1987; Norman, 1963). To remember the Big Five traits, use the acronym OCEAN. The development of a personality test to measure the five traits has made it possible for many investigators to explore the Big Five theory scientifically (see Figure 12.7). The current version of the test is known as the NEO-PI-R Inventory (Costa & McCrae, 2011). You will have an opportunity to take a short version of this test in this chapter. Each of the Big Five traits consists of a continuum from one extreme to the other. We will discuss the five traits in order of the OCEAN acronym. OpennessOpennessA Big Five personality trait characterized by an appreciation for fantasy, feelings, actions, ideas, values, and aesthetics.            Openness        A Big Five personality trait characterized by an appreciation for fantasy, feelings, actions, ideas, values, and aesthetics.             to experience involves fantasy, aesthetics (an appreciation for the arts), feelings, actions, ideas, and values. People high on openness are curious, unconventional, and imaginative. They are interested in exploring aspects of life that are different from their own, whether this means trying new foods, traveling to exotic locations, or studying other religions. People low on openness are more practical, traditional, and conforming. They prefer the familiar over the new, choosing a chain restaurant in a new city rather than experimenting with the local cuisine. ConscientiousnessConscientiousnessA Big Five personality trait characterized by competence, order, dutifulness, achievement striving, self-discipline, and deliberation.            Conscientiousness        A Big Five personality trait characterized by competence, order, dutifulness, achievement striving, self-discipline, and deliberation.             incorporates competence, order, dutifulness, achievement striving, self-discipline, and deliberation. People high on this trait are reliable, work hard, and complete tasks on time. People low on this trait are unreliable, somewhat lazy, and undependable. It is frustrating to work on group projects with people who are low in conscientiousness, but under some circumstances, they make valuable contributions. For example, they might identify unnecessary steps in a process, reducing the time pressure felt by a group, or promote some forms of outside the box thinking and problem solving. ExtroversionExtroversionOne of the Big Five traits characterized by warmth, gregariousness, assertiveness, activity, excitement seeking, and positive emotion; opposite of introversion            Extroversion        One of the Big Five traits characterized by warmth, gregariousness, assertiveness, activity, excitement seeking, and positive emotion; opposite of introversion             is characterized by warmth, gregariousness, assertiveness, activity, excitement seeking, and positive emotion, although extroverts also tend to be insensitive and overbearing. IntroversionIntroversionOne of the Big Five traits characterized by coolness, reserve, passivity, inactivity, caution, and negative emotion; opposite of extroversion            Introversion        One of the Big Five traits characterized by coolness, reserve, passivity, inactivity, caution, and negative emotion; opposite of extroversion             is characterized by coolness, reserve, passivity, and caution, although introverts also tend to be sensitive and reflective. Extroverts seek social activity and find it invigorating, whereas introverts want time to themselves to recharge their batteries. AgreeablenessAgreeablenessA Big Five personality trait characterized by trustworthiness, altruism, trust, compliance, modesty, and tender mindedness            Agreeableness        A Big Five personality trait characterized by trustworthiness, altruism, trust, compliance, modesty, and tender mindedness             includes trust, straightforwardness, altruism, compliance, modesty, and tender mindedness. People low in this trait are cynical, uncooperative, and rude. It is challenging to identify advantages for a trait like disagreeableness. In employment settings, however, disagreeable people are capable of making tough decisions, whereas their more agreeable colleagues find it difficult to supervise others (Rust, 1999). In one study, men who scored below the mean on measures of agreeableness earned 18% more than men who were more agreeable (Judge, Livingston, & Hurst, 2012). People who score high on the trait of openness are curious, unconventional, and imaginative. Finally, neuroticismneuroticismA Big Five personality trait characterized by anxiety, angry hostility, depression, self-consciousness, impulsivity, and vulnerability.            neuroticism        A Big Five personality trait characterized by anxiety, angry hostility, depression, self-consciousness, impulsivity, and vulnerability.             combines anxiety, angry hostility, depression, self-consciousness, impulsivity, and vulnerability. The opposite trait could be described as emotional stability. Although scoring high on neuroticism sounds unpleasant, this trait has survival advantages (Zhang, Chrétien, Meaney, & Gratton, 2005). In threatening and impoverished environments, high neuroticism increases a person’s chances of surviving to reproduce. We observed a similar argument in Chapter 11, in which a child’s insecure attachment to the parents had benefits for survival in a dangerous environment (Belsky, 1999). Whether considering a personality trait or attachment, the anxious, clinging child is more likely to stay near protection, enhancing survival in dangerous situations. Across a range of professional, skilled, and unskilled job descriptions, the conscientiousness variable had the greatest positive correlation with work-related success (Barrick & Mount, 1991). Surprisingly, the same meta-analysis found little relationship between agreeableness and job performance. Big Five traits have provided a framework for investigating job performance (Barrick & Mount, 1991), parenting style (Prinzie, Stams, Deković, Reijntjes, & Belsky, 2009), psychological disorders and substance abuse (Kotov, Gamez, Schmidt, & Watson, 2010), cognitive decline in older adulthood (Curtis, Windsor, & Soubelet, 2014), happiness (DeNeve & Cooper, 1998), academic performance (Komarraju, Karau, & Schmeck, 2009), and many other specific outcomes. Evidence across diverse cultures, including the United States, Japan, South Korea, Germany, Portugal, Israel, and China, suggests that these personality traits represent universal human characteristics (McCrae & Costa, 1997). Out of the Big Five characteristics, conscientiousness shows the highest positive correlation with work-related success, whether a person is employed in a professional, skilled, or unskilled job. The full version of the Big Five Inventory (BFI) contains 44 items. The 10-item version in Table 12.1 has served as a reasonable substitute for the full test for research purposes when time is limited (Rammstedt & John, 2007). If reading about the different Big Five traits has left you wondering about your own personality, this is your chance to get an idea of where you stack up on each of these factors.1.

Scores of 1 or 2 are low conscientiousness, scores of 4 and 5 are high conscientiousness, and a score of 3 is neutral. Neuroticism: Q4R (Reverse) and Q9 Add (6 minus your answer on Q4) to your answer on Q9, and divide the sum by 2. Scores of 1 or 2 are low neuroticism, scores of 4 and 5 are high neuroticism, and a score of 3 is neutral. Openness: Q5R (Reverse) and Q10 Add (6 minus your answer on Q5) to your answer on Q10, and divide the sum by 2. Scores of 1 or 2 are low openness, scores of 4 and 5 are high openness, and a score of 3 is neutral. Circle the number that represents your best answer for each item. At the end, we’ll tell you how to add up your scores. A self-report test like this is only as good as you make it by answering honestly. Wanting to appear socially desirable by downplaying your negative characteristics might make you feel better, but this approach reduces the validity of the test results. At the same time, no paper-and-pencil test is perfect, and if a result does not fit the way you honestly view your personality, feel free to disagree with the results.Not all psychologists agree that personality originated in stable traits that produce consistent patterns of behavior across different situations. Research showing that situations could exert a stronger influence on people’s behavior than any individual predispositions highlighted limits to the general trait approach. We discuss several of these situations in Chapter 13. For example, studies of obedience or conformity might be better understood by evaluating the situations people encounter rather than the predispositions or traits they bring to the laboratory (Asch, 1951;  Milgram, 1963). Kurt  Lewin (1951) argued that a person’s behavior (B) is a function of the person (P) and the person’s environment (E). This led to a vigorous debate regarding which element, personality or the situation, produced the greatest influence on behavior. Historically, many psychologists continued to focus on personality traits. More recent work has demonstrated an increasing respect for the influences of situational variables on behavior. Personality may predict typical behaviors performed by individuals, but situations often provide better insight into cases in which people behave in uncharacteristic ways (Sherman, Rauthmann, Brown, Serfass, & Jones, 2015). As predicted by Lewin, personality and situations usually interact. For example, individual personality traits influence the types of situations we choose to encounter as well as the way we think about those situations, which in turn reinforces the original personality traits (Rauthmann, Sherman, Nave, & Funder, 2015). In other cases, the power of situations can have large and lasting effects on personality. For example, the experience of unemployment produced long-term changes in individual levels of agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness (Boyce, Wood, Daly, & Sedikides, 2015). Is this man helping these women because of his individual personality traits? Or do situational variables do a better job than personality traits at predicting behavior?Personality is usually studied, not surprisingly, in individuals, but one situation that might have a particularly strong influence on personality is being in a group. At least in the case of fish, individual personality is sometimes suppressed in groups in favor of the collective decisions of the school (McDonald, Rands, Hill, Elder, & Ioannou, 2016). Fish, like humans, show individual differences in boldness, or the willingness to accept reward over risk. The boldness of individual fish tested alone is quite consistent, but the behavior of the same fish within a school of fish is not. This suggests that at least in the area of risk-taking, testing individuals might give psychologists very different results than testing the same people in a group setting. Midway in the 20th century, some behaviorists began to think in more cognitive terms and believed that learning theories of personality had neglected motivations, emotions, and cognitions. These behaviorists recognized the importance of personality in social contexts, where behavior is shaped and rewarded by interactions with other people. The resulting social–cognitive learning theoriessocial–cognitive learning theoriesA theory of personality that features cognition and learning, especially from the social environment, as important sources of individual differences in personality.            social–cognitive learning theories        A theory of personality that features cognition and learning, especially from the social environment, as important sources of individual differences in personality.             are consistent with our observations that single perspectives in psychology do not always capture the whole story.One influential social–cognitive learning theory featured a concept known as locus of controllocus of controlA cognitive expectancy featured in social–cognitive learning theories of personality about the source of individual outcomes; an external locus of control sees outcomes as resulting from luck or chance, while an internal locus of control sees outcomes as the result of individual effort.            locus of control        A cognitive expectancy featured in social–cognitive learning theories of personality about the source of individual outcomes; an external locus of control sees outcomes as resulting from luck or chance, while an internal locus of control sees outcomes as the result of individual effort.             (Rotter, 1966). If you have an external locus of control (locus means place in Latin), you expect that most of your outcomes occur because of chance, luck, opportunity, or other factors beyond your control. However, if you have an internal locus of control, you believe that most of your outcomes are due to your own talent and effort. People with an internal locus of control manage stress more effectively, floss their teeth more regularly, are more likely to seek shelter in response to tornado warnings, use their seat belts more consistently while driving, and are more likely to practice effective birth control (Wallston, 2005). However, people with an internal locus of control tend to be less sympathetic with the plight of others, viewing their troubles as due to their choices and behavior as opposed to outside forces they can’t control (Lane, 2001). People with an internal locus of control believe that most of our outcomes are due to our own efforts, while people with an external locus of control believe that our outcomes are more often due to factors beyond our control. Although people with an internal locus of control experience less stress, they tend to be less sympathetic with the plight of others. The person with an internal locus of control might believe this woman needs to try harder to escape homelessness, while the person with an external locus of control might believe this woman just needs help and better opportunities.Albert Bandura, whom we met in Chapter 8, attempted to capture a balance between external, environmental factors and internal traits in his theory of reciprocal determinismreciprocal determinismA social–cognitive learning theory of personality that features the mutual influence of the person and that of the situation on each other.            reciprocal determinism        A social–cognitive learning theory of personality that features the mutual influence of the person and that of the situation on each other.             (Bandura, 1990,  1993). Like other social–cognitive learning theorists, Bandura rejected the strict behaviorism of Skinner as applied to personality. He agreed with Skinner that the environment can determine behavior but thought that it does so reciprocally, as people influence the environment through both their internal cognitions and their behavior. Bandura believed that observation of others’ behavior played an important role in the development of personality. Although much of his work centered on aggression, Bandura believed that many other characteristics were learned in this same manner. He was particularly interested in self-efficacy (Bandura, 1990,  1993,  1995). This characteristic refers to confidence in your abilities to gain reinforcement. If self-efficacy is high, you have strong expectations that positive outcomes are within reach. If you study hard and get good grades, you expect to obtain a good job in your chosen career. However, if self-efficacy is low, you might doubt your abilities to reach your goals. Self-efficacy can be situation specific. You might be confident in your abilities in science but less so in your abilities in rock climbing. Self-efficacy influences a person’s environment and experiences. A confident job candidate is probably more likely to be hired than an applicant who appears insecure. Self-efficacy is the belief that you can handle a challenging situation and obtain future rewards.Walter Mischel argued that trait theories could not explain the variation in an individual’s behavior across situations (Mischel, 1968). For example, when 51 boys at a summer camp were observed, their extroversion–introversion scores did not predict their extroverted or introverted behaviors across 21 situations (Newcombe, 1929). Instead of focusing on traits alone, Mischel argued that the stability we expect in a person’s behavior arises from that individual’s characteristic way of interpreting situations (Mischel, 2004). To illustrate this process, consider two children who both score high on some measure of aggression. Trait theorists would expect the children to be consistently more aggressive than their low-scoring peers regardless of circumstances, yet these are precisely the results that Mischel found to be lacking in actual studies (Mischel, 1968). Instead, an individual child’s behavior can be predicted by considering if–then relationships between situations and behavior (Mischel & Shoda, 1995). One child may be aggressive when approached by peers but respond passively to an adult’s efforts to apply discipline, while another might show the opposite pattern. In other words, if the child experiences a particular situation (interacting with peers or adults), that child then responds with a unique, stable set of behaviors (aggressive or passive). These if–then patterns are characteristic of an individual, leading to the stable characteristics we think of as personality.Biological theories of personality build bridges between observed traits and their underlying biological correlates. Among the biological variables connected to personality are temperament, genetic predispositions, and brain structure. These variables serve as behavioral phenotypes that can be used to compare and contrast underlying genetic profiles (Skuse, 2000).We introduced the concept of temperamenttemperamentA child’s pattern of mood, activity, or emotional responsiveness linked to later personality.            temperament        A child’s pattern of mood, activity, or emotional responsiveness linked to later personality.            , or a child’s pattern of mood, activity, or emotional responsiveness, in Chapter 11. Contemporary psychologists believe that temperament is biological in origin (Rothbart, 2011) but quickly begins to interact with the social and physical environments. Not only does a bold, fearless child select different activities, but that child is treated differently than a quiet, cautious child by peers, parents, and teachers. As we have observed in this chapter, children demonstrate individual differences along several dimensions of temperament, including positive emotionality, negative emotionality, and effortful control (Shiner & DeYoung, 2013). While we have emphasized a role for biology in temperament, it is clear that environment also plays important roles. Preschool-aged children are in a state of transition as they become less dependent on their parents and begin to venture into a world featuring more peer interaction. The Question: Does increased interaction with peers influence preschoolers’ temperament traits?Two classrooms of 3- and 4-year-olds at a university preschool were observed over the course of one year. Trained observers rated the children for temperament traits and observed their social networks. A total of 15,387 observations were taken and analyzed. Children are subject to enhanced protection when they serve as research participants. In a university preschool, it is likely that parents have signed a global consent for their children to participate in research. To the extent that they can understand, children can withhold assent to participate even when their parents approve their participation. Temperament traits were stable over the year of observation, but some change did occur. Children who were high in negative emotionality were less likely to be selected as a play partner. Children with high levels of positive emotionality formed social relationships with others sharing this trait. Over the year, children’s levels of positive emotionality and effortful control became more like that of their playmates (see Figure 12.8). Children’s temperaments shape their choice of peer relationships, as shown by the clustering of the children with higher levels of positive emotionality. At the same time, longitudinal observations show that children’s temperaments also shape those of their playmates. The results of this study suggest that for preschoolers, positive emotionality and effortful control are contagious. This finding is consistent with research using adults that show people become more similar to others with whom they associate in the expression of positive emotion, such as happiness (Fowler & Christakis, 2008). A married partner who is high in conscientiousness has a positive influence on the other partner’s work outcomes, above what would be predicted by the other partner’s own conscientiousness (Solomon & Jackson, 2014). In contrast, children’s negative emotionality did not seem to be influenced by their peers, perhaps because children with high negative emotionality experienced fewer peer interactions. They would have fewer opportunities to model (see Chapter 8) the more positive behaviors of their peers. Several dimensions of temperament are particularly important for adult personality, including reactivity and self-regulation (Ahadi & Rothbart, 1994;  Rothbart, Ahadi, & Evans, 2000;  Rothbart & Derryberry, 1981). Reactivity describes differences in people’s responses to novel or challenging stimuli. People’s responses may vary in terms of both intensity and timing. Some people respond to such stimuli immediately with highly intense anxiety, others respond more slowly, and some barely notice the stimuli. Self-regulation involves the ability to control attention and inhibit responding to perceived stimuli. These dimensions of temperament appear to be related to the Big Five traits. Higher reactivity is characteristic of introversion and neuroticism (Aron et al., 2010), while self-regulation is associated with later conscientiousness (Rothbart, Sheese, Rueda, & Posner, 2011). Other discussions of temperament separate reactivity into positive emotionality and negative emotionality (Shiner & DeYoung, 2013). Differences in the temperament dimension of reactivity predict children’s responses to novel or challenging stimuli. Children with high reactivity often display high introversion and neuroticism later in life.The early emergence of temperament suggests a genetic origin for personality. Large genomewide association studies (GWAS) have identified six genetic loci that are significantly associated with the Big Five traits (Lo et al., 2017). These loci also are predictive of different types of psychological disorders (see Chapter 14 and Figure 12.9). A genome-wide analysis (GWAS) identified relationships between six genetic loci, personality traits, and several types of psychological disorders. Narrow angles between arrows, such as between ADHD and extroversion indicate stronger correlations. Arrows pointing in opposite directions, such as agreeableness and autism, indicate negative correlations. The effects of genetics on personality often use the twin study method, such as the Minnesota Study of Twins Reared Apart (Bouchard, 1994;  Bouchard, Lykken, McGue, Segal, & Tellegen, 1990). In this ongoing research, Thomas Bouchard and his colleagues have studied 59 pairs of identical twins and 47 pairs of fraternal twins who had been raised in separate families, as well as a larger number of twins raised in the same home. The pairs of identical twins were quite similar, regardless of whether they were raised together. Some characteristics showed stronger positive correlations between identical twins, such as their scores on an occupational interest scale. Other characteristics showed relatively weaker positive correlations, such as nonreligious social attitudes. The critical finding was that the identical twins raised apart and together were similar to each other, whether the overall positive correlation for a particular characteristic was strong or weak (see Figure 12.10). Some characteristics, such as the number of ridges you have in your fingerprints, are more strongly influenced by genetics than other characteristics, such as your nonreligious social attitudes. Regardless of how much genetic influence a trait might have, identical twins show considerable similarity, whether they grow up in the same household or not. The Big Five personality traits show an approximate heritability of 0.50 in humans (Jang, Livesley, & Vernon, 1996;  Loehlin, McCrae, Costa, & John, 1998). As discussed in Chapter 3, heritability refers to populations rather than individuals. Saying that a trait such as shyness has a heritability of 0.40 does not mean that 40% of a person’s shyness is produced by genes and the other 60% is produced by the environment. Instead, a 0.40 heritability ratio suggests that across the human population, the variations we see in shyness from high to low are influenced moderately by both genetics and environmental factors. Adrian and Julian Riester were identical twin friars who died within hours of each other at the age of 92. Their shared experiences of more than 65 years as members of the Franciscan order probably accentuated their genetic similarities. If genetics accounts for about half of the variability seen in the population’s personality, what is the source of the other half? Environmental influences take the form of shared experiences, which affect all members of a family, and nonshared experiences, which affect an individual. For example, you and your siblings might attend the same elementary school and have Thanksgiving dinner with the extended family (shared experiences) while studying different musical instruments, having different friends, or playing different sports (nonshared experiences). Knowing the heritability for a trait like extroversion does not tell us much about the development of an individual’s personality. Heritability estimates are similar to knowing the overall average annual temperature in North America. Although this information could be useful for the study of global climate trends, it doesn’t tell us whether California is likely to have more wildfires or whether the skiing industry in Colorado will have a good year. We know that the population heritability for positive emotionality is between .46 and .52, but this doesn’t tell us how heritability interacts with shared and nonshared environments to produce particular outcomes (Krueger, South, Johnson, & Iacono, 2008). For example, depending on teenagers’ perceived relationship with their parents, the heritability of positive emotionality can vary widely. The positive emotionality of teens who perceive their relationship with their parents as poor is more strongly predicted by their individual, or nonshared, experiences, whereas the positive emotionality of teens who enjoy strong relationships with their parents is more strongly predicted by genetics (Krueger et al., 2008). These fine-tuned analyses of the interactions of nature and nurture are likely to provide psychologists with more accurate views of the sources of personality (see Figure 12.11). Without taking environment into account, genetics explains between 46% and 52% of the variability we see in positive emotionality. However, we gain a better understanding of positive emotions when we also consider environments, such as teens’ relationships with their parents. When teens report a positive relationship with their parents, most of the variation we see in their positive emotionality is genetic, but when their relationship with their parents is poor, their positive emotionality is better predicted by their individual experiences than by their genetics. In spite of their heritability, personality traits are far from being set in stone. We observed earlier that confronting experiences such as unemployment can produce wide-ranging influences on personality. Researchers have even noted that if you want to change a personality trait (for example, by becoming more agreeable), that can actually be done (Hudson & Fraley, 2015). Not only can people change personality traits on purpose, but the change will be reflected in their relevant behaviors.Given the genetic influence on personality and the early emergence of temperament in life, it is reasonable to assume that individual differences in personality are reflected in brain structures. Early efforts to link personality and biology examined the correlations between extroversion and neuroticism traits and the activities of the autonomic nervous system and reticular formation, structures involved with arousal discussed in Chapter 4 (Eysenck, 1967). Brain structure correlates in adults with four of the Big Five personality traits: Extroversion, agreeableness, neuroticism, and conscientiousness (Canli, 2009;  DeYoung et al., 2010). The differences in structure occur in logical places. For example, people who differ in neuroticism show different volumes of areas of the prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and hippocampus, areas that have been implicated in sensitivity to threat and stress. Variations in conscientiousness are associated with different volumes in areas of the prefrontal cortex involved with planning and the voluntary control of behavior (DeYoung et al., 2010). Measures of the Big Five traits of conscientiousness are positively correlated with the volume of areas in the prefrontal cortex involved with planning and the voluntary control of behavior. Activity in brain networks forms the basis of another personality model called reinforcement sensitivity theory (RST). Individual differences in approach, avoidance, and inhibition of behavior reflect the activity of three brain networks: the behavioral approach system (BAS), the fight–flight freeze system (FFFS), and the behavioral inhibition system (BIS) (Gray & McNaughton, 2003;  Kennis, Rademaker, & Geuze, 2013). Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), researchers have mapped the networks in which activity successfully predicts individual differences in these three dimensions of behavior (Kennis et al., 2013). Variations in BAS activity predict a person’s response to reward, or impulsivity. The FFFS is active when an organism experiences unlearned punishment or lack of reward, while the BIS is active when an organism senses learned signals for punishment or lack of reward (Gray, 1970;  Gray, 1987). Individual differences in FFFS activity correlate with reactivity, described earlier, while BIS activity is associated with anxiety levels or neuroticism.If we accept the idea that personality characteristics are influenced by genetic factors leading to individual differences in brain structure and function, an interesting question arises: How might differences in personality have evolved? Evolutionary psychologists argue that the Big Five traits are present across a variety of cultures because they influence survival for the entire species (Buss, 1996,  1999). Identifying personality in other species would support this evolutionary approach. Ivan Petrovich Pavlov, discussed in Chapter 8, noticed that individual dogs responded differently to frustration: Some responded cheerfully, others responded with anger, some went to sleep, and still others appeared to have a nervous breakdown (Pavlov, 1906). Using a modified human personality questionnaire to evaluate animals, extroversion and neuroticism have been identified in hyenas, octopuses, guppies, rats, pigs, dogs, cats, donkeys, monkeys, gorillas, and chimpanzees (Gosling, Mollaghan, & Van Lange, 2006). Agreeableness, which might form the basis for cooperative behavior, has been observed to vary in nonhuman primates (Adams, 2011). However, the only species identified as showing variations in conscientiousness were humans and chimpanzees (Gosling et al., 2006). After noticing that staff at the Seattle Aquarium had been naming their octopuses based on their behavior (from shy Emily Dickinson to destructive Lucretia McEvil), Jennifer Mather tested 44 octopuses systematically for their responses to stimuli, such as being touched with a brush. The octopuses seemed to have unique and stable responses, similar to having a personality.Personality is assessed or tested for a variety of reasons, including the refinement of personality theories, diagnosing psychological disorders, selecting employees, or making decisions in courts of law. In everyday life, we assess other people’s personalities by listening to them and watching their behavior. Observation remains one of the most reliable means of making personality judgments about others (Leichtman, 1995; Asendorpf, Banse, & Mücke, 2002). However, observation takes precious time and can be biased, as we will discuss in Chapter 13. In addition to observation, we rely on interviews. Although a skilled interviewer might obtain reliable information, it is also easy for the person being interviewed to conceal some aspects of personality. To avoid the pitfalls of observation and interview, many psychologists turn to standardized tests of personality. In Chapter 2, we noted that good tests require validity and reliability. A valid test literally does the job it is advertised to do. For example, if you constructed a test of creativity, people with high scores on your test should demonstrate more creativity than do people with lower scores. A reliable test returns similar results when it is interpreted by different observers or is taken repeatedly. The results of most standardized personality tests rely on self-report, which introduces errors. Self-reports can be influenced by a person’s need to appear socially appropriate (Cyders & Coskunpinar, 2011). An individual applying for a job in sales is unlikely to admit to being shy. In Chapter 9, we distinguished between conscious or explicit and unconscious or implicit memories. Self-report measures do a good job of tapping into our explicit information about our personalities but may not capture implicit aspects of personality (Asendorpf et al., 2002). Furthermore, answers on a questionnaire may indicate a person’s beliefs but have relatively less to say about how a person would behave. Claiming to be honest on a questionnaire says little about whether a cashier will steal money from the cash register, as we will explore in Chapter 13. Increasingly, analysis of data from cell phones or social media provides personality psychologists with ecologically valid snapshots of real behavior (see Figure 12.12). Alternately, a growing field of personality neuroscience takes another methodological route. Answers on standardized instruments are correlated with observed differences in brain structure and activity (DeYoung et al., 2010). Personality psychologists can take advantage of data from social media platforms such as Facebook to obtain ecologically valid snapshots of real behavior. Not surprisingly, the Big Five trait of extroversion correlates with the number of friends a person has on Facebook but only for those whose numbers of friends are in the top 50% of users. Perhaps avoiding human judgment altogether might give us even more accurate information about personality. Researchers constructed a computer algorithm that assesses a person’s likes on Facebook (Youyou, Kosinski, & Stillwell, 2015). The resulting assessment of a person’s Big Five personality traits turned out to be more accurate than the assessments made by work colleagues, friends, roommates, and family members (see Figure 12.13). Only a person’s spouse could rival the computer. As entertaining as these results might be, they do raise significant privacy concerns. A computer analysis of the Facebook likes of 86,220 people provided a more accurate assessment of their personalities, as measured by responses to a 100-item online questionnaire, than judgments made by their human friends.Personality inventoriesPersonality inventoriesAn objective test, often using numbered scales or multiple choice, used to assess personality            Personality inventories        An objective test, often using numbered scales or multiple choice, used to assess personality             are objective tests, often using numbered scales or multiple choice, such as the short Big Five test that you took earlier in the chapter. These tests have advantages over more subjective measures, such as interviews or observation. Large numbers of people can be assessed quickly and inexpensively. Many of the tests perform quite well in terms of reliability and validity (McCrae, Kurtz, Yamagata, & Terracciano, 2011)We can learn quite a bit about what kind of person we have just met through an interview, but it is also relatively easy for people being interviewed to present an inaccurate view of their personality. A frequently used personality inventory is the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), published in the early 1940s and most recently revised in 2001. This test compares the responses of typical people with those hospitalized for a psychological disorder to a number of true–false items (see Figure 12.14;  Hathaway & McKinley, 1940,  1943). For example, responses to the statement I usually feel that life is worthwhile and interesting might differentiate between people who either are or are not depressed. People with schizophrenia, but not others, are likely to agree with the statement I seem to hear things that other people can’t hear. Although the MMPI was designed to assist with clinical diagnosis, this is only one of its present-day uses. The publisher’s website suggests that the test can also be used for college and career counseling recommendations, screening of potential public safety employees, marriage and family counseling, and many other purposes (Pearson Assessments, 2005). The MMPI compares a participant’s responses along several dimensions to people with diagnosed psychological conditions. Scores above 65 are cause for concern. In this case, the individual scored normally with the exception of his score on scale 4, which is the psychopathic deviate scale. This scale measures conflict, struggle, anger, and respect for society’s rules. This person might be diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder, which we discuss in Chapter 14. The MMPI has been joined by hundreds of additional objective tests featuring personality characteristics, including the NEO-PI-R, which assesses the Big Five traits. Most of these tests use response scales rather than the true–false options of the MMPI. These numbered scales are often called Likert scales, after Rensis  Likert (1932). For example, you might be asked to select the number that best describes you: Outgoing 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 WithdrawnProjective testsProjective testsA test of personality based on Freudian theory that provides an ambiguous stimulus onto which test takers project their personality.            Projective tests        A test of personality based on Freudian theory that provides an ambiguous stimulus onto which test takers project their personality.             are derived directly from projection, one of Freud’s defense mechanisms. According to the psychodynamic approach, tests can access the unconscious mind by displaying an ambiguous stimulus, onto which the test participants project their personalities as they describe the object. A famous projective test, the Rorschach Inkblot Test, contains 10 different inkblots, some in color and others in black and white (Rorschach, 1921). The job of the participants is to describe what each inkblot looks like to them. These responses are written down by the examiner and scored according to a manual. For example, the examiner might note that a participant talked about a portion of the inkblot instead of the entire image. This response would be scored as indicating the participant’s concrete, rather than abstract, way of thinking. Despite serious questions about its reliability and validity (Wood et al., 2010;  Wood, Nezworski, & Lilienfeld, 2003), the Rorschach Inkblot Test remains more widely used than the MMPI. Out of a randomly selected group of 1,000 therapist members of the American Psychological Association, 82% reported using the Rorschach at least occasionally, and 43% use it frequently or always (Watkins, Campbell, & Nieberding, 1995). Swiss psychologist Hermann Rorschach (1884–1922), the son of an artist, was nicknamed Klecks, or inkblot, by his high school classmates because of his hobby of making inkblot pictures. After becoming a psychiatrist, he became curious about why people saw the inkblots differently, and he began analyzing their responses. Despite poor validity and reliability, the Rorschach Inkblot Test continues to be used widely. One of the most widely used personality tests is the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), which is based on the work of Carl Jung. More than 2 million Americans take the MBTI annually, and most of the top employers in the United States use it for employment purposes (Paul, 2010). After answering several forced-choice questions, the MBTI sorts you into 1 of 16 possible personality types combining four dimensions: Extroversion–introversion, sensing–intuition, thinking–feeling, and judging–perceiving. In our discussion of personality testing, we noted that validity and reliability were essential features of any good test. How does the MBTI hold up on these criteria? Unfortunately, the answer is not well (Druckman & Bjork, 1991). Validity describes how well a test measures what it is supposed to measure. Two approaches to evaluating the validity of the MBTI are using factor analysis and assessing the predictive power of the MBTI (Pittenger, 1993). Factor analysis allows researchers to explore correlations among items on a personality test such as the MBTI. If the MBTI is a valid model, the factor analysis should identify the four clusters, answers to the questions associated with each cluster should be highly correlated with each other, and the questions that fit in a cluster statistically should make sense. In other words, an item stating, I like to be the life of the party should be found in the extroversion– introversion cluster (Pittenger, 1993). Items in the MBTI do not meet these validity criteria well. What about the predictive power of the MBTI? One of the major uses of the test is in career counseling and employment. Unfortunately, there is no evidence that certain MBTI types are more successful than others in an occupation, that certain types are more satisfied with their occupations, or that certain types remain in their occupation longer (Pittenger, 1993). What about the reliability of the MBTI? If your personality as measured by the MBTI is stable, we would expect little variation as you take the test multiple times. However, even with test–retest intervals as short as 5 weeks, as many as 50% of all test takers will be classified into different types on the second try (Pittenger, 1993). This leaves us wondering why tests that do not meet the standard criteria for validity and reliability are still used. Why is the Rorschach Inkblot Test still admissible to American courts of law? Why do employers invest in the MBTI for their employees? One reason is our love of insight, which drives otherwise reasonable people to consult horoscopes, tarot cards, palm readers, and crystal balls. Upon receiving a description of their MBTI profile, many people have an aha moment, but the same could be said of horoscopes. In fairness, however, tests like the MBTI are so well marketed and used by so many reputable institutions that it is natural for the public to feel a level of trust (see Figure 12.15). Not only is the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator questionable in terms of validity and reliability, but this real-world application of the test to an automobile customer’s choice for a hands-free, foot-activated liftgate in her car is not in the best scientific tradition. As a fun example of how this works, let’s analyze Carrie—she’s an ESFP and the target customer for the Ford Escape compact utility vehicleOutgoing and socialExtraversionSpacious seating for five friendsShe lives in the moment and travels to experience lifeSensingHer powerful EcoBoost engine delivers the fuel efficiency to feed her curiousityStays true to her values, beliefs and idealsFeelingIntelligent 4WD system helps the vehicle stay groundedI know marriage and family is in my future.

Understanding their strengths and weaknesses requires a sophisticated mastery of statistics that most people simply do not possess. However, what we all can do is use our best critical thinking skills and ask meaningful questions about the validity and reliability of the tests we are asked to take rather than passively assuming the tests are what they’re advertised to be.Personality tests are used by therapists, potential employers, judges, attorneys, educators, and others, raising important ethical concerns. Who gets to see these data? How are they stored? For what purposes may they be used? Is the examiner trained in the administration and evaluation of tests? In many cases, such as in the use of the MMPI, sensitive and private data are generated. In other cases, like the Rorschach Inkblot Test, the results are at best controversial. This widely used test has described normal children as having problems approaching psychosis (Garb, Wood, Lilienfeld, & Nezworski, 2005;  Hamel, Shaffer, & Erdberg, 2000). Using invalid results to make important real-world decisions could be disastrous. The American Psychological Association has wrestled with these questions, incorporating some conclusions regarding the disclosure of test data into the organization’s code of conduct (American Psychological Association, 1996/2007). Should you be asked to take a personality test, it would be prudent to fully educate yourself regarding the test and make an informed decision about whether to proceed.

William James (1890, p. 330) argued in favor of the belief in a distinct principle of selfhood and believed that such a principle could be studied scientifically. Knowing something about the personalities of others makes it easier for us to anticipate what others will feel, think, or do and, therefore, to interact more effectively with them. But what about the patterns of thought, feelings, and actions we see in ourselves? When we think about this personal knowledge, we are thinking about the selfselfPatterns of thought, feelings, and actions that we perceive in our own minds.            self        Patterns of thought, feelings, and actions that we perceive in our own minds.            . A person’s sense of self combines a number of separate factors (Kahn, 2013). Having a self means having a sense of unity, or of being a single human. The self incorporates a history or a sense of continuity. This aspect of self helps us organize our personal knowledge on a timeline, providing us with a past, present, and future. A sense of embodiment means that the self is embedded in the body (as opposed to the sensation of having an out-of-body experience, discussed in Chapter 6). A self has free will, or the feeling we can do whatever we want to do, and self-location, which means we understand our current location. The self uses a first-person perspective. Finally, the self is embedded in a social network and is influenced by the quality of those relationships. Psychologists approach the study of the self by examining the ABCs: Affect, behavior, and cognition. The affective or emotional components of the self include our evaluation of the self or level of self-esteem, discussed in greater detail later in this chapter. Behavior and self-concept form reciprocal relationships. We gain self-knowledge by observing our behavior, and our concepts of the type of people we are influence our behavior. Cognitive processes help us organize information and think about the self.For the moment, set aside your reading and make a list of 10 things that complete the sentence I am. If you are like most college students, this description of your self-conceptself-conceptPeople’s description of their own characteristics.            self-concept        People’s description of their own characteristics.             includes references to demographic factors, such as age, sex, or student status (first year or psychology major); personality features (outgoing or shy); relationships with others (friend, lover, daughter, son, sister, or brother); physical attributes (pretty, tall, or brown eyed); and various other roles (athlete, club member, or Texan). Our self-concept captures the way we see ourselves, which we often portray through our choice of social networking profile pictures. Here are your authors’ current profile pictures on Facebook. What do your profile pictures say to others about you?We use self-schemasself-schemasA cognitive organization that helps us think about the self and process self-relevant information            self-schemas        A cognitive organization that helps us think about the self and process self-relevant information             to think about these many aspects of the self (Markus, 1977). As we discussed in Chapters 10 and 11, schemas provide cognitive structures for organizing information. The structure provided by a self-schema influences not only the way you view yourself but also how you view and interact with others. A major implication of having a self-schema is that we process self-relevant information differently than information about others. For example, we might think about our own brown hair in different ways than we think about our neighbor’s brown hair. This self-reference effect (SRE) was demonstrated when four groups of participants were given lists of adjectives to memorize with different instructions (Rogers, Kuiper, & Kirker, 1977). The first group judged the size of letters making up the word, the second group judged whether the word rhymed with another word, the third group judged whether the word had the same meaning as another word, and the last group judged whether the word described them. The fourth group’s recall for the words was subsequently superior to recall by the other groups (see Figure 12.16). These results implied that the self provided a superordinate schema (Rogers et al., 1977, p. 685). Participants in this experiment were asked whether a word was in larger font (structural), rhymed with another word (phonemic), meant the same thing as another word (semantic), or described the participant (self-reference). As you can see from these results, when participants used their self-schemas to consider a word, later recall for the word was better than when the word was considered structurally, phonemically, or semantically. These results suggest that your memory for material you are studying will be improved by thinking about how it relates to your own life. Questions remain, however, as to the true cause of the observed SRE. Is there something special about self-schemas, or is the SRE simply a result of general memory processes such as depth of processing or elaboration, which we discussed in Chapter 9? For example, memory enhancement also occurred in a group that judged whether words described the study participants’ mothers (Bower & Gilligan, 1979). We may remember self-relevant information simply because we know a lot about the subject—ourselves.When answering the questions posed in the previous section, how do you know what to say? To know yourself requires you to make the self an object to be examined. Just as you try to figure out what kind of people your classmates and instructor are, you have the capacity to turn this analysis inward to the self. Self-awareness, or knowledge of your own internal traits, feelings, roles, and memories, is the result of this self-study. In addition, self-awareness allows us to establish boundaries between the self and other people. When we talk about ourselves, look at ourselves in a mirror, watch a video of ourselves, or stand out from the crowd in some way, we become more self-aware than usual. This state of heightened self-awareness can be quite unpleasant. Many people experience a negative mood when they look in a mirror (Fejfar & Hoyle, 2000). Related to this negative self-awareness is the concept of self-consciousness, our awareness of our own characteristics and the way the self is perceived by others. In many cases, we overestimate how much attention others pay to our behavior, a phenomenon known as the spotlight effect. When student participants wearing an embarrassing T-shirt featuring 1970s pop singer Barry Manilow entered a room full of other students, they expected at least half of their fellow students to notice (Gilovich, Medvec, & Savitsky, 2000). In fact, only 23% of the students paid attention to the T-shirts. The particularly active spotlight effect that accompanies puberty is responsible for substantial pain during adolescence (Elkind, 1967;  Elkind & Bowen, 1979). Teens are convinced that their every flaw and blemish is scrutinized by others. How reassuring it would be to understand that other teens are so worried about the imaginary audience’s reactions to their own flaws that they scarcely have time to notice the flaws of others. Self-consciousness might be unpleasant, but it makes people behave more ethically. When children were instructed by a sign to take only one Halloween candy, they were more likely to comply when they could see their image in a mirror (Beaman, Klentz, Diener, & Svanum, 1979). In a similar study, an honor-system coffee bar featured either a poster showing a pair of eyes or a poster showing a bouquet of flowers (Bateson, Nettle, & Roberts, 2006). People were more likely to put money in the box to pay for their coffee when they saw the poster of the eyes (see Figure 12.17). Use of body cameras by police officers, raising their self-awareness of their actions, has decreased officers’ use of force and number of complaints (Ariel, Farrar, & Sutherland, 2015). The amount of money collected in a college department honor-system coffee bar relative to consumption was measured by tracking milk consumption (this study was conducted in the United Kingdom, where coffee is rarely consumed black). Donations increased when a poster of eyes appeared above the bar and decreased when a poster of flowers appeared above the bar. Self-consciousness, perhaps from feeling watched by the photograph of eyes, typically results in more ethical behavior. Whether we are responding similarly to the large numbers of surveillance cameras in our environments remains to be demonstrated through future research. How do we obtain self-knowledge? An obvious source of self-awareness is the process of introspection, or the direct observation of one’s own thoughts and feelings. After all, who is in a better position to know what goes on inside our heads than we are? Unfortunately, as we discussed in Chapter 1, introspection is not considered reliable. Barry Manilow might have sold millions of records in the 1970s, but students in 2000 thought wearing this shirt would be embarrassing. We tend to overestimate how much attention others pay to us, though, and only 23% of study participants noticed the T-shirt. Perhaps we could bypass mental states and focus instead on our observable behavior. People seem to use their behavior as a clue to their characteristics, just as any other observer does (Bem, 1972). If they see themselves behaving in a kindly way toward others, maybe they are kind people. In support of this approach, people who were gently encouraged to provide flattering descriptions of themselves scored higher on a subsequent test of self-esteem (Jones, Rhodewalt, Berglas, & Skelton, 1981). In other words, if they observe themselves providing a positive self-analysis, it must be true. The people around us also contribute to our self-knowledge. We use the reactions of other people like a mirror to see our own characteristics, developing a looking-glass self. We also incorporate the opinions of significant others into our self-concept. If our parents viewed us as brilliant, it is likely that we would view ourselves as brilliant too. Using the reactions of others works better when defining some characteristics than others. If our parents inaccurately view us as brilliant, we soon learn the truth at school. If they unfairly think we’re lazy, though, it is more difficult to figure out they’re wrong. An obvious component of self-knowledge arises from autobiographical and episodic memories, described in Chapter 9. Who we are today is intimately linked with the self from the past that we remember. While offering valuable information about who we are, episodic and autobiographical memories can provide a partial, incomplete, and occasionally inaccurate picture. As one psychologist noted, The past is remembered as if it were a drama in which the self was the leading player (Greenwald, 1980, p. 604).Not only do we form a self-concept, but we also judge its value. This personal report card is known as self-esteemself-esteemA judgment of the value of the self.            self-esteem        A judgment of the value of the self.            . Self-esteem may be global, based on our overall self-worth, or specific, relating to particular characteristics such as appearance or intelligence. Self-esteem introduces an emotional aspect to our self-concept. Not only do we judge ourselves, but we experience emotional responses to that judgment. Judgments of the self are not necessarily accurate. Most people experience positive illusions, which lead them to judge themselves more positively and less negatively than they judge others (Taylor & Brown, 1988). Despite inaccuracies, people who experience positive illusions enjoy a heightened sense of well-being. People with high and low self-esteem respond differently to failure. The low self-esteem person overgeneralizes from failure (Brown & Mankowski, 1993). In other words, people with low self-esteem who fail one exam might assume that they are going to fail all their classes. This tendency to overgeneralize might explain why people with low self-esteem are more prone to depression (Sowislo & Orth, 2013), discussed further in Chapter 14. In contrast, people with high self-esteem respond to failure in one domain by exaggerating their abilities in other domains (Brown & Smart, 1991). If people with high self-esteem fail an exam, they are more likely to remind others about how great they are in sports, appearance, or dating. Because of the importance of self-esteem to psychological well-being, psychologists have looked at the origins of self-esteem carefully. Many psychologists believe that the process of developing self-esteem begins early in childhood, and stable self-esteem has been observed as early as age 5 (Cvencek, Greenwald, & Meltzoff, 2016). Long before children have a working model of the self, they experience the emotional consequences of acceptance and rejection (Erikson, 1963;  Sroufe, Carlson, & Levy, 2003). As we discussed in Chapter 11, children form secure or insecure attachments with their primary caregivers (Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters, & Wall, 1978; Bowlby, 1969), which predict a child’s self-esteem at the age of 6 years (Cassidy, 1988). Self-esteem does not appear to change much over the life span (Block & Robins, 1993;  Trzesniewski, Donnellan, & Robins, 2003). Early differences in self-esteem seem to be magnified and reinforced over time because having high or low self-esteem influences both the selection of activities and the reactions of others to the self. Self-esteem is also influenced by social comparisons, or the judgments we make of our own worth relative to those around us (Festinger, 1954). The impact of social comparisons on self-esteem was demonstrated in an experiment in which researchers placed an advertisement for a research assistant (Morse & Gergen, 1970). Prospective employees found themselves in a waiting room with another candidate, who was actually an actor working for the experimenters. The actor took the role of either Mr. Clean or Mr. Dirty. Participants waiting with Mr. Clean experienced drops in self-esteem, whereas the self-esteem of participants waiting with Mr. Dirty rose. Dove, a division of Unilever that produces skin and hair care products, lists its social mission as building women’s self-esteem. The company reports that only 4% of women worldwide consider themselves beautiful. To combat the influence of upward social comparisons, in which girls and women judge their attractiveness against the impossibly beautiful images of women in the media, Dove has committed to using diverse, natural looking models in their advertisements. Psychologists have been curious about the effects of social media on social comparisons and self-esteem. Viewing selfies frequently on social media is negatively correlated with self-esteem (Wang, Yang, & Haigh, 2016). People with a high need for popularity responded more dramatically to viewing selfies. The same researchers reported that viewing groupies frequently was positively associated with self-esteem. People with high self-esteem tend to make downward comparisons, in which they compare themselves to those they consider less worthy on a particular dimension. For example, a beautiful woman with high self-esteem is more likely to congratulate herself on how much better looking she is than her friends but is unlikely to compare herself with Hollywood beauties. In contrast, people with low self-esteem are likely to do the opposite. A beautiful woman with low self-esteem will engage in upward comparisons, chastising herself because she doesn’t measure up to the most beautiful women in the world. Regardless of self-esteem, we all seem to engage in a reassuring type of downward comparison when viewing our own pasts (Wilson & Ross, 2000). Most of us look back in time with a sense that we have improved. Our virtues are greater today than they used to be, and our faults are less. Given the influence of social comparisons on self-esteem, we might suspect that belonging to certain social groups would affect an individual’s self-esteem. If you are a member of a privileged group in society, for example, shouldn’t you have higher self-esteem than people who have experienced prejudice and discrimination?Higher rates of depression among women, discussed further in Chapter 14, might suggest that females have lower self-esteem than males. In a very large meta-analysis representing thousands of participants, males had a very small advantage over females in self-esteem (Kling, Hyde, Showers, & Buswell, 1999). This advantage is larger in adolescence and early adulthood but dissipates with age. Similar meta-analyses of self-esteem demonstrated differences based on race and ethnicity in the United States (Erol & Orth, 2011;  Twenge & Crocker, 2002). As we noted in Chapter 11, beginning in adolescence, black Americans score higher than white Americans in measures of self-esteem. However, Americans identifying themselves as Asian or Native American scored below white Americans in measures of self-esteem. Hispanic adolescents had lower self-esteem than white teens but reported higher self-esteem at age 30 than white Americans (Erol & Orth, 2011). Cultural differences among groups might account for some of these results. As we mentioned previously, people in more collectivistic cultures might avoid standing out from the group by giving themselves highly positive ratings (see Figure 12.18). Results from tests that tap into implicit attitudes by asking participants to associate themselves with either positive words (glorious, happy, or laughter) or negative words (agony, horrible, or nasty) suggest that Asian Americans have about the same level of self-esteem as white Americans, but cultural values of modesty usually override their outward expression of that self-esteem (Greenwald & Farnham, 2000). Apparent cultural differences in self-esteem must be evaluated carefully. Using explicit measures of self-esteem, it appears that white Americans have higher self-esteem than Asian Americans. However, when implicit measures of self-esteem are used, this difference disappears, suggesting that the observed difference is probably because of cultural norms related to modesty. Culture plays an additional role in self-esteem by setting the values by which people measure themselves. Adherence to cultural values, more so than to individual values, were shown to predict self-esteem across 20 different cultural settings (Becker et al., 2014). Although individual achievement is an important part of self-esteem, finding meaningfulness through belonging to multiple groups is also a predictor of a person’s self-esteem (Jetten et al., 2015). The group membership effect on self-esteem is not simply a matter of having more friends but more likely from a sense of belonging to something larger than the self. The good news is that most of us feel rather positively about ourselves. The bad news is that we are a wee bit unrealistic. People who perform most poorly are the most likely to engage in self-enhancement by inflating their opinions of themselves. College students who performed in the bottom 12% on tests of logic, grammar, and humor guessed that they performed better than 62% of their peers (Kruger & Dunning, 1999). As student performance increased, the amount of inflation decreased. Some people begin protecting their self-esteem long before a performance takes place. In self-handicapping, people begin to build an excuse in advance, just in case they fail (Berglas & Jones, 1978). Self-handicapping strategies take many forms, including taking drugs, failing to practice or do homework, commenting on poor health or stress, or sandbagging. Sandbagging occurs when you let everyone know how bad you are at something. By lowering expectations of your performance, nobody will notice much when you fail. Although self-handicapping may protect your self-esteem, it does not make you popular with others (Rhodewalt, Sandonmatsu, Tschanz, Feick, & Waller, 1995). Another method self-enhancement is to associate with others you admire. This approach has been labeled the bask-in-reflected-glory (BIRG) effect (Cialdini et al., 1976). On the Monday following a football game, university students are more likely to wear sweatshirts with their school’s name if their team won than if it lost. We are equally quick to distance ourselves from failure. Many an athlete or performer has been surprised at how many friends they have during successful times and how quickly those friends disappear when times are tough. The bask-in-reflected-glory (BIRG) effect predicts that sales of apparel featuring a winning team are likely to be much higher than those for a losing team. Associating with those we admire can produce self-enhancement. Self-enhancement may serve to protect self-esteem, but it can have many unwanted effects. Primary among these negative side effects is being disliked by others. People who engage in self-enhancement typically make good first impressions, but these impressions do not last (Paulhus, 1998). Having high self-esteem provides several benefits both to the individual and to the groups to which the individual with high self-esteem belongs. Among the advantages of high self-esteem for individuals are happiness and persistence (Baumeister, Campbell, Krueger, & Vohs, 2003). These outcomes occur because high self-esteem acts as a buffer. When faced with bad news, people with high self-esteem are more likely to weather the storm than are people with low self-esteem. In addition, high self-esteem enhances social dominance within a peer group (Juvonen, 2005). Self-esteem contributes to belongingness or the maintenance of good social relationships (Baumeister & Leary, 1995;  Leary, 2004;  Leary & Downs, 1995;  Leary, Tambor, Terdal, & Downs, 1995). Because social rejection could have such devastating effects on survival in our evolutionary past, self-esteem could have emerged as a way of estimating the likelihood of rejection. Self-esteem drops following the experience of social exclusion (Leary et al., 1995). A drop in self-esteem serves as an early warning signal that rejection by the group is imminent, and behavior designed to regain the favor of the group should be initiated. Terror management theory suggests that self-esteem serves as a protection against our fear of death. When people are reminded of their own mortality, self-esteem can increase. Ironically, these labels proposed by the government for cigarette packages might have the unintended consequences of enhancing, rather than diminishing, favorable attitudes about smoking. Some smokers equate smoking with improving their image, which in turn improves their self-esteem (Hansen, Winzeler, & Topolinski, 2009). A terror management theory suggests that self-esteem interacts with a cultural worldview to buffer our fear of death (Greenberg, Pyszczynski, & Solomon, 1986;  Pyszczynski, Greenberg, & Solomon, 1991). Cultural worldviews can include shared beliefs that allow us to attain feelings of immortality, whether through producing children, writing books, or believing in an afterlife. By conforming to these cultural worldviews, people enjoy enhanced self-esteem that reduces their anxiety related to death. Having members with high self-esteem is an advantage to groups in several respects. People with high self-esteem are more likely to speak critically when in groups (LePine & Van Dyne, 1998). Groups that do not have members who are willing to question group decisions might fall prey to poor decision-making, discussed further in Chapter 13. People with high self-esteem not only value themselves but also value the groups to which they belong (Aberson, Healy, & Robero, 2000). People with low self-esteem do not show this favoritism. If a group is highly valued by its members, its overall success is likely to be enhanced, which in turn benefits its members. In 1989, the california task force on self-esteem and personal and social responsibility published a report that declared many, if not most, of the major problems plaguing society have roots in the low self-esteem of many of the people who make up society (Mecca, Smelser, & Vasconcellos, 1989, p. 1). Teachers, parents, and therapists express similar beliefs and actively work to increase the self-esteem of others. These approaches mirror a commonsense attitude toward self-esteem. High self-esteem seems more desirable than low self-esteem, and interventions designed to raise self-esteem appear on the surface to be a good thing. How accurate are these views of self-esteem?Self-esteem and school grades are positively correlated, although the effects are not large (Hansford & Hattie, 1982). The important question, however, is whether high self-esteem is a result or a cause of good grades. As we discussed in Chapter 2, it is not possible to use correlational data to determine causal factors. Consider the example of students who achieve very high grades. Does the students’ success reflect the impact of high self-esteem, or does the achievement of high grades make the students feel more positively about themselves? Or like many correlations, is an unidentified third factor such as intelligence or social class responsible for the observed correlation?Although many people believe that raising children’s self-esteem is a good thing, research suggests that self-esteem is more likely to be the outcome rather than the cause of behavior. Providing feel-good messages that are not based in real achievement can backfire (Forsyth & Kerr, 1999). Explicit efforts to identify the causal relationships between self-esteem and school performance have failed to support the commonsense hypothesis that high self-esteem produces good performance. A sample of 1,600 young males in the 10th grade was followed for an additional 8 years (Bachman & O’Malley, 1977). No evidence for a causal role for self-esteem in school performance was discovered. Instead, third factors, including socioeconomic status, IQ, and early school performance, appeared responsible for the correlation between self-esteem and school performance. Among studies that have reported a causal relationship between self-esteem and school performance, the direction of the relationship is not consistent with the commonsense hypothesis. High self-esteem is more likely to be a result of good grades, not vice versa (Rosenberg, Schooler, & Schoenbach, 1989). What do these findings mean for efforts such as the California Task Force, which sought to raise achievement by improving self-esteem? Unfortunately, interventions intended to boost self-esteem can backfire. When students receiving poor grades on a midterm were sent an e-mail message designed to boost their self-worth, they performed significantly worse on the next exams than did students in control groups (Forsyth & Kerr, 1999). This study provides an important lesson: Providing indiscriminate feel-good messages that are not anchored in achievement results in lower achievement. If relationships between school achievement and self-esteem are weaker than many believe, what about the relationships between self-esteem and social problems such as aggression? Again, our commonsense hypotheses fail us. We have heard parents, teachers, and legislators lament that many social problems would dissipate if only we could raise self-esteem. This commonsense notion was challenged by Roy Baumeister and his colleagues, who discovered that aggressive people were more likely to have positive and frequently inflated views of their self-worth (Baumeister et al., 2003;  Baumeister, Smart, Boden, & Baumeister, 1999). Contrary to many stereotypes, bullies typically do not suffer from low self-esteem. They experience less depression, less anxiety, and less loneliness than prosocial youth and are likely to be considered by peers the coolest kids in their classes. (Juvonen, 2005).To meet the expectations we have for ourselves, we engage in self-regulation, also known as self-control or willpower. Self-regulation consists of conscious executive efforts to control our thoughts, motives, feelings, and behaviors (Carver & Scheier, 2000). Failures to regulate behavior frequently lead to some of the most perplexing problems facing society, including drug abuse, domestic violence, and binge eating. In addition, deficits in self-regulation characterize several psychological disorders we discuss in Chapter 14, including schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Sometimes when we try to use our self-regulation abilities to not think of something (Whatever you do, don’t think about white bears), we end up thinking quite a bit about the object we wish to avoid. Individual differences in self-regulation, as we observed earlier in this chapter, are apparent at young ages. While a certain amount of self-regulation is related to training and supervision on the part of adults, individuals show different patterns of brain activation while facing temptation. Increased activity in the nucleus accumbens, which is implicated in processing reward and addiction, is associated with self-control failures, such as eating something we intended to pass by. Simultaneously, higher activity in the prefrontal cortex was associated with an individual’s ability to withstand temptation (Lopez, Hofmann, Wagner, Kelley, & Heatherton, 2014). In self-regulation, we make distinctions between what is good for the current self (eating a yummy treat) and what is good for the future self (having good health). We perceive the future self more like a different individual who stands in judgment of our current choices. Thus, activity in brain areas associated with self-centered (egocentric) thinking is associated with more impulsive and selfish decisions (Soutschek, Ruff, Strombach, Kalenscher, & Tobler, 2016). Self-regulation is made even more difficult because the harder we think about not doing something, the more likely we are to do it (Wegner, 1994). Try, for example, to avoid thinking about a white bear for the next 30 seconds. If you are like most people, your thoughts were suddenly dominated by images of white bears. We can explain this phenomenon as follows. When you try to control your behavior, you simultaneously activate a concern about failing. In an effort to avoid failure, you automatically pay more attention to the item or behavior to be avoided. What exactly is this white bear thing I should avoid? Because of this attention, we end up doing what we hoped to avoid doing. A widely distributed network of brain structures participates in processing the different aspects of self. Self-referential processing, or the processing of information relevant to ourselves but not others, can occur in our emotional, facial, memory, motor, social, spatial, and verbal domains.If the mind is the product of the activity of the nervous system, is it possible to locate the self within these patterns of activity? This question suggests that information about the self is processed in unique and special ways by the nervous system (Gillihan & Farah, 2005). As we have seen so far in this chapter, the concept of self can mean many things. Brain correlates have been found for knowledge of our own bodies—their configuration, appearance, and location—as well as for memories of personal experiences, interpersonal connections, and use of a first-person perspective. Given the large number of different aspects of the self, it should not be surprising that a widely distributed network of brain structures participates in the processing of the self (Cacioppo & Decety, 2011b). Activity in the default mode network or DMN (see Chapter 6) is often associated with thinking about the self (Kahn, 2013). However, during thinking about the self, activity in the DMN is joined by activity in parts of the brain that process external sources of information, such as the awareness of other people and the environment. These observations remind us of our constant use of context when we think about ourselves. An important aspect of the self is the recognition of our own faces. The right hemisphere plays a special role in distinguishing our own faces from those of other people. In one study, one hemisphere of each participant’s brain was made inactive using an anesthetic. When study participants then viewed a photograph combining one half of their face with the half-face of a famous person, they recognized themselves when the left hemisphere was anesthetized but reported seeing the famous person when the right hemisphere was anesthetized (Keenan, Nelson, O’Connor, & Pascual-Leone, 2001; see Figure 12.19). Participants in this experiment viewed blended faces made from one half of their own photograph and one half of a photograph of a famous person. When the participants’ left hemispheres (LHs) were anesthetized, leaving the right hemisphere (RH) active, they believed the photo was their own (a). When their right hemispheres were anesthetized, leaving the left hemisphere active, most believed the photo showed the famous person (b). These results suggest that for many people, the right hemisphere plays a role in recognizing our own faces. In addition to playing an important role in recognizing our own faces, the right hemisphere is necessary for the construction of stable traits and attitudes. The location of brain damage (right hemisphere only, left hemisphere only, or both hemispheres) can be correlated with observed changes in personal characteristics that usually show little change over time, such as political views and religious beliefs (Miller et al., 2001). Only people with right hemisphere damage alone showed changes in these normally stable characteristics. Schizophrenia, which we discuss in Chapter 14, produces distortions in a person’s sense of self (Feinberg, 1978). One common symptom is a delusion of control or the sense that some external agent is either monitoring or influencing a person’s behavior. This delusion is highly relevant to our current discussion, because it represents confusion over the behavior produced by the self or by others. For example, people with this symptom might describe their behavior as controlled by others through implants in their brains. A comparison of brain activity during such delusions and after they recede indicated that the delusions of control were correlated with excess activity in the right hemisphere (Spence et al., 1997).The self we have discussed so far represents the personal self or the attributes that differentiate an individual’s self from all others (Brewer & Gardner, 1996). This self both shapes and is shaped by interactions with others. Just who those others are and how they interact with the self has been the subject of significant psychological inquiry. When we interact with significant others, such as family members, we experience the relational self. When we interact with larger groups, such as other fans supporting the same sports team, such as these Brazilian soccer fans, we experience the collective self. William  James (1890) remarked that an individual has as many different social selves as there are distinct groups of persons about whose opinion he cares (p. 294). In other words, in addition to having a personal self, we experience an interpersonal selfinterpersonal selfThe self we are in the presence of other people            interpersonal self        The self we are in the presence of other people            . In current psychological discussions of the self, influences on the interpersonal self fall into two categories: A person’s significant others and the social groups to which the person belongs. Significant others include family members, friends, coworkers, and others with whom the self interacts or has interacted. As we interact with significant others, we experience the relational self (Brewer & Gardner, 1996;  Chen, Boucher, & Tapias, 2006). The influence of the larger groups to which we belong provides our collective self (Brewer & Gardner, 1996). We have seen how cultural values can influence the experience of self. Regardless of culture, however, all humans share both a need for independence and a need to belong. Is it possible to show that situations can modify a person’s emphasis on individualistic and collectivistic values?To investigate the effects of the situation on cultural values, thinking about independence versus interdependence was manipulated by reading a story about a general choosing a warrior to send to the king (Gardner, Gabriel, & Lee, 1999). The stories differed in the warrior chosen (the best individual for the job versus a member of the family) and in the benefits of the choice (benefits to the general versus benefits to his family). A control group did not hear a story. The effects of the two stories were assessed by asking study participants to complete a values inventory that measures how obligated a person feels to help others. Participants hearing the independence version of the warrior story, regardless of culture, produced more individualistic responses to the values survey than collectivistic responses. Participants hearing the interdependence version of the warrior story, again regardless of culture, produced more collectivistic responses to the values survey than individualistic responses. Although we tend to think of culture influencing the self, this experiment demonstrated that views of the self as independent or interdependent can be changed by a person’s immediate situation (such as hearing a story that emphasizes one aspect or the other). This result supports the ideas that both the need for independence and the need to belong are human universals and that the relative dominance of one over the other is modifiable through experience and situational variables (see Figure 12.20). Listening to a story that emphasized individualistic or collectivistic values elicited congruent responses from study participants, regardless of whether they lived in an individualistic culture (United States) or a collectivistic culture (Hong Kong). These results suggest that both independent and interdependent views of the self are human universals, and the relative dominance of one over the other is modifiable by a person’s experience and situation. The concept of the interpersonal self implies that an individual’s self is more flexible and complex than it would be based on a personal self alone. This flexibility is illustrated by the suggestion that we have a relational self when we are with a particular person, such as the me when I’m with mom (Chen et al., 2006, p. 153). It is likely that a great deal of overlap occurs among the many interpersonal selves we experience, but recognizing that we may not be consistent across all social situations is important. The differences we experience echo the discussion earlier in the chapter about personality traits and situations. Given the interpersonal dimensions of the self described in the previous section, it should come as no surprise that the concept of the self means different things in different cultures. One aspect of cultural differences that is particularly relevant to the study of the self is the distinction between individualism and collectivism (see Figure 12.21). Individualism is characterized by an emphasis on independence and self-reliance. In contrast, core values of collectivism include interdependence, cooperation, and lack of conflict. As we discussed in the introduction to this chapter, these relative weightings of self and others tend to characterize entire nations. The United States, Australia, Great Britain, Canada, and the Netherlands appear to be the most individualistic, while Venezuela, Colombia, Pakistan, Peru, Taiwan, and China appear to be the most collectivistic (Hofstede, 1980). Geert Hofstede compared cultures on five dimensions relevant to individualism and collectivism. Compared to the Chinese, Americans are less tolerant of unequal distributions of power (PDI), more likely to expect self-reliance (IDV), about equally assertive and competitive rather than modest and caring (MAS), more tolerant of ambiguity and lack of structure (UAI), and far less thrifty and persistent (LTO). PDI: Less powerful accept and expect that power is distributed unequally. IDV: Refers to individuals or groups, not the state, and their role in taking care of you. MAS: Higher numbers indicate more assertive and competitive, rather than modest and caring. UAI: Tolerance for ambiguity, unstructured situations. LTO: Thrift, perseveranceTwo major differences occur between highly individualistic cultures and more collectivistic cultures (Markus & Kitayama, 1991). The first difference predicts a person’s source of satisfaction. People in individualistic cultures feel best about themselves when they experience personal achievement, whereas people in collectivistic cultures feel good about belonging to a successful group. For example, a baseball player from an individualistic culture, such as the United States, might take pride in having a terrific batting average even though his team is losing, whereas the player from a more collectivistic culture, such as Japan, might feel better about being a member of the top team regardless of his personal performance. The second difference predicts a person’s sense of being similar to other group members. In individualistic cultures, people are more likely to see themselves as unique. In collectivistic cultures, conformity and appearing like others are more highly valued. White American and Korean study participants were offered the gift of a pen, which they were to choose from a group of three or four pens of the same color and one pen with a unique color. Whereas 74% of the white Americans chose the uniquely colored pen, 76% of the Koreans chose a pen with the more common color (Kim & Markus, 1999). The individualistic–collectivistic nature of a culture is a moving target across time (Hamamura, 2012), and our characterization of particular social groups requires constant updating. For example, a recent meta-analysis of individualism and collectivism among European Americans, African Americans, Latino Americans, and Asian Americans suggest that although minor differences remain, values related to individualism and collectivism are becoming more similar across these groups (Vargas & Kemmelmeier, 2013). Personality provides a perfect opportunity to revisit the birds of a feather flock together theme that we discussed previously in this textbook. Is it true that people with similar personalities are attracted to each other?In Chapter 11, we discussed research that showed that people in long-term relationships who have similar personalities experienced different levels of satisfaction at different stages in their relationships (Shiota & Levenson, 2007). Early in a relationship, similarity was particularly important to promoting bonding and intimacy. But what happens when we take one more step backward in time to look at the effects of similarity when two people first meet each other?In one study, pairs of heterosexual, opposite-sex college students were left in a waiting room while a researcher ran an errand (Cuperman & Ickes, 2009). Without their knowledge, the pairs’ interactions were filmed. As predicted by birds of a feather, pairs of introverts and pairs of extroverts reported having a better conversation and liking their partner more (see Figure 12.22). However, similarity in agreeableness was not so important. Leaving two disagreeable people together did not result in a pleasant conversation. Surprisingly, though, having at least one agreeable person produced the same quality of interaction as having two agreeable people. Apparently, agreeable people know how to produce a good interaction whether or not their partner is equally capable. Introverts conversing with other introverts and extroverts conversing with other extroverts were more likely to believe their partner would want to interact in the future than pairs in which one person was introverted and the other was extroverted. When agreeableness was investigated, one disagreeable person having a conversation with another disagreeable person was not very positive, but as long as one of the partners was agreeable, the conversation went well. You might be wondering how personality similarities compare to other factors when people first meet, and the answer is not well, at least in the context of a speed-dating session for college students (Luo & Zhang, 2009). Under these circumstances, the overwhelming determinant of attraction for both men and women was physical appearance. No similarity in attitudes and Big Five characteristics significantly predicted attraction. This outcome might be one of the reasons we are cautioned to get to know each other better before becoming involved in a serious relationship. If similarity plays an important role in long-term satisfaction, even with the bumps and bruises of middle age described by Shiota and  Levenson (2007), it appears that we need more time than the speed-dating situation provides to make important relationship decisions. It seems intuitive to predict that bullies have lower levels of emotional self-regulation than nonbullies, and this is in fact what the results of scientific studies demonstrate (Garner & Hinton, 2010). Individuals with more self-control in regard to their anger and frustration are less likely to lash out and dominate others. However, as many people have learned the hard way, it’s easier to be impulsively and very publicly aggressive online than in person. Thus, cyberbullying might present unique challenges for emotional self-control compared to face-to-face bullying. Middle school bullies, regardless of whether they engage their victims in person or through digital technology, are able to perceive the emotional responses of others (Baroncelli & Ciucci, 2014). If anything, launching a successful attack demands that the bully have the ability to anticipate the victims’ responses. We can safely say that the bullies are not wreaking havoc by mistake—they understand the pain they are inflicting. What they seem to lack is the ability to inhibit their behaviors using emotional self-control. A difference between types of bullies appears, however, when you ask bullies to rate their own emotional regulation abilities. Face-toface or traditional bullies did not perceive themselves as having a problem with selfregulation, but cyberbullies gave themselves (perhaps more accurately) lower grades on emotional self-regulation (Baroncelli & Ciucci, 2014). This increased awareness of their own deficits might lead the would-be bully to the safer method of cyberbullying. Traditional (face-to-face) bullies differ from cyberbullies in that the former do not perceive themselves as having problems with emotional self-regulation. In contrast, cyberbullies rate themselves as having lower emotional self-regulation. It is possible that this leads them to participate in the safer method of cyberbullying rather than traditional bullying. While we have seen in previous chapters that the same individuals often participate in both traditional bullying and cyberbullying, recognizing differences in the patterns of behavior between these two domains could better inform intervention programs and policies. Addressing the low levels of emotional self-regulation found in both types of bullies is important, but self-efficacy in controlling one’s emotions seems particularly relevant to cyberbullying.Be sure you can define these terms and use them correctly.`;
