Do we have free will? Transcranial magnetic stimulation switched the hand chosen to carry out a task from right to left, but participants insisted that switching hands was their own idea.What does it mean to have free will? this might sound more like a philosophy question than a psychology question, but advances in biological and cognitive psychology have allowed psychologists to tackle it.Usually, we think of free will as the ability to consciously control our actions and decisions. In the children’s game of rock, paper, scissors, we feel like we are making a conscious decision to choose one of the three options, but how would such a decision be made? What types of processes in the brain correspond to choosing scissors over the other two possibilities?Research into voluntary movements, such as forming your hand into scissors, has shown that the brain makes a commitment to a choice as much as 10 seconds before we become aware of the decision (Soon, Brass, Heinze, & Haynes, 2008). Other research shows that the brain can be manipulated to make an unusual choice without disrupting the individual’s sense of free will. Right-handed people normally use their right hand 60% of the time or more when forced to choose to use one hand over the other, but when researchers exposed right-handed subjects’ right hemispheres to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), illustrated in the large image on the previous page, they chose to use their left hand 80% of the time (Ammon & Gandevia, 1990). Despite making the uncharacteristic choice to use the wrong hand, the participants in this experiment reported feeling in control of their hand movements. If the brain has already committed to a movement, what purpose does a conscious sense of having decided to move serve? Insight into this question emerged from the study of split-brain patients described in Chapter 4. These patients have undergone surgery that severs the connections between their right and their left hemispheres, making it possible to expose one hemisphere at a time to a stimulus. For example, you can show the relatively nonverbal right hemisphere the word stand, and the patient usually stands up. However, because of the limitations of the right hemisphere in processing language, the patient is consciously unaware of having read the word. When asked why they stood up, patients responded by saying they felt the need to stretch. In other words, the mind is building a theory about the behavior that was just performed (Gazzaniga, 2012). This type of observation leads to a view of consciousness as an interpreter, making sense out of our actions and the world within and around us. This view helps us understand the observed delay between the brain’s commitment to an action and our conscious awareness of that decision—the interpreter needs time to analyze the situation.Social context plays a role in sleep, even for the fruit fly. Fruit flies living with other fruit flies rather than alone need more sleep, suggesting that one of the functions of sleep is to process learning about social experiences. The larger the group of flies, the longer each fly needed to sleep.In this chapter, we will explore many situations that affect the performance of the interpreter, from the variations found in stages of sleep and waking to the alterations produced by psychoactive drugs and damage to the brain. This journey will require us to zoom in to observe underlying processes in the brain and then zoom out again to understand the influences of the social context on the phenomenon of conscious awareness.

Our English word conscious is derived from the Latin conscientia, which means to know. ConsciousnessConsciousnessA state of awareness.

 refers to knowing or being aware of ongoing experiences occurring both internally and in the world around us. We understand that to be unconscious, perhaps because of a blow to the head, means that we are unaware of what is happening within and around us. However, the term consciousness has multiple meanings. Consciousness can refer to a state of awareness (alert versus drowsy, for example) or the current content of awareness (while reading this page, you hear your neighbor’s music). A special type of consciousness, self-awarenessself-awarenessThe special understanding of the self as distinct from other stimuli.

, occurs when we focus on ourselves as individuals.Consciousness has been a favorite topic among psychologists for many years. William James (1899, p. 15) coined the term stream of consciousness to capture the moving, seemingly unbroken flow of conscious awareness. Sigmund Freud used the term consciousness to refer to aspects of the mind that could be retrieved voluntarily, in contrast to the unconscious parts of the mind that remain hidden to voluntary searches for information. Contemporary cognitive psychologists debate why some information becomes conscious while other information does not (Baars, 1988).

Most of us would agree that bacteria do not possess consciousness, but people do. This implies that consciousness emerged at some point in the course of evolution. The exact location of that point remains highly debatable. James (1890, p. 141) maintained that consciousness grows the more complex and intense the higher we rise in the animal kingdom. That of a man must exceed that of an oyster. If consciousness evolved as suggested by James, what advantages might account for this development?The question of the emergence of consciousness in animals is complicated by the multiple meanings of consciousness described previously. Most animals show variations in states of awareness. Even the humble fruit fly takes periods of rest, which are believed to be the fruit fly equivalent of sleep (Shaw, Cirelli, Greenspan, & Tononi, 2000). Consciousness defined as an awareness of ongoing sensations is probably less common in the animal kingdom. Many animals would survive quite well by simply responding automatically to the world around them (food or predator) without necessarily thinking I smell food or I see a predator. The self-awareness aspect of consciousness—as exemplified in I statements—might be the rarest of all among living things, as we will see later.Varying states of awareness might allow animals to repair their bodies and conserve energy. Food requirements would be higher if we stayed awake for 24 hours, as you may have noticed while studying for final exams. Another possible benefit of varying states of awareness is maximizing safety. Most animals are specialized for activity in either the light or the dark. Sleeping during the cycle for which an animal is poorly equipped for activity might contribute to its survival. However, being inactive is not a safe thing to do unless you have a safe place to hide (Allison & Cicchetti, 1976). Horses and rabbits are both frequently preyed upon, but horses sleep in the open, while rabbits sleep in burrows. Consequently, wild horses sleep as little as 1 or 2 hours per day, while wild rabbits sleep at least 8 hours.Sleeping habits of different species reflect how likely they are to be preyed upon by other animals and whether they have shelter. The lion has few predators and is likely to fall asleep wherever it is convenient.One possible advantage of being consciously aware of ongoing sensations is the ability to choose responses rather than to respond instinctively (Gazzaniga, 2011). If suddenly faced with a predator, any animal could respond automatically using reflex and instinct, which we discuss in Chapter 8. Horses are notorious for running whenever the slightest stimulus bothers them. It is unlikely that the horse in these cases is thinking, I hear a mountain lion—I should run. Conscious awareness of sensations provides more options. If a conscious animal hears a sound in the distance that might indicate the presence of a predator, it could choose to continue on, flee, or pause while obtaining further information. This flexibility would be likely to increase the animal’s chances of survival.The self-awareness aspect of consciousness could heighten an animal’s drive to survive. Recognition and understanding of being alive is correlated with heightened meaningfulness of self-preservation.Developmental psychologists have provided a technique for demonstrating self-awareness that can be used with many species. Recognizing one’s self in the mirror is believed to be a major developmental milestone in achieving self-awareness. In the so-called rouge test, a dot of rouge or other odorless dye is placed on a child’s forehead, and the child is allowed to look in a mirror (Lewis & Brooks-Gunn, 1979). Before the age of about 18 months, children do not seem to indicate that they understand the image in the mirror is their own. At about that age, they rub at the spot of rouge or turn their bodies to get a better look, thus demonstrating self-awareness.Chimpanzees pass the rouge test by demonstrating behavior similar to that of 18-month-old children (Gallup, 1970). In addition to chimpanzees, orangutans, gorillas raised by humans, bottle-nosed dolphins, Asian elephants, magpies, and parrots have demonstrated self-awareness in this type of experiment (Gallup & Suarez, 1986;  Patterson, 1984;  Patterson & Cohn, 1994;  Plotnik, de Waal, & Reiss, 2006;  Povinelli, 1993; Prior, Schwarz, & Güntürkün, 2008).Other researchers restrict the possibility of self-aware consciousness to species that exhibit complex social behavior. Of what use would self-awareness be if one did not frequently interact with others of the same kind? Social animals must be able to recognize other individuals and respond to them accordingly. Dolphins appear to have special whistles that they seem to use for particular individuals, like names (Janik, Sayigh, & Wells, 2006). Some social animals, including chimpanzees and elephants, show an awareness of death and appear to grieve at the loss of family members. Elephants in particular have been known to remain in the area of a relative’s bones for lengthy periods (McComb, Baker, & Moss, 2006).Babies 18 months and older are able to recognize themselves in a mirror, which psychologists believe indicates a sense of self-awareness. Happy the elephant, a resident of the Bronx Zoo, repeatedly used her trunk to touch a mark that researchers placed above her eye, suggesting that she too can recognize her image in the mirror. Researchers have suggested that even robots might be able to pass the mirror test.Organisms like the army ant stretch our definitions of what it means to be conscious. Individual army ants (Eciton) are not impressive, but colonies of army ants show signs of collective intelligence and sophisticated problem solving, such as using their bodies to build nests of up to 700,000 individuals (Franks, 1989).Extending the question of what creatures are conscious a step further, we can ask whether it is possible to construct an artificial consciousness. From the Terminator to Her’s Samantha, Hollywood loves to tell the story of the machine that develops consciousness. Stephen Hawking, Bill Gates, and Elon Musk warn us that self-aware robots are likely to jeopardize the continuity of the human race.What does it mean for a machine to be conscious? John  Searle (1980) distinguishes between strong and weak artificial intelligence (AI). Weak AI, which all current robots possess, refers to the ability to demonstrate intelligent behavior but without the ability to experience conscious states or subjective awareness. Strong AI refers to machines possessing the full range of human cognition.How would we judge whether a machine has achieved consciousness? In 1950, Alan Turing devised a test of a machine’s ability to think. According to the Turing test, if a human had a conversation with two other beings, one human and one machine, without being able to distinguish between them, then the machine would have passed the test. The 2014 Eugene Goostman program, which impersonated a 13-year-old from the Ukraine, managed to convince 10 out of 30 judges that he was human. The ability to meet Turing’s criteria may be within reach.One Nao robot appears to have the answer to the dilemma posed to the group, which researchers claim is evidence for self-awareness.One type of consciousness discussed in this chapter is self-awareness. Selmer Bringsjord and his colleagues (2015) claim that their robots have demonstrated evidence of self-awareness in the mirror test described in this chapter. In another demonstration, the researchers told three Nao robots that two were given dumbing pills to prevent them from speaking, while one was given a placebo. In actuality, mute buttons were pressed on two of the robots. When asked who had been given the active pills, all three tried to answer, but of course only one was able to say, I don’t know. The robot paused, then stood up and said, Sorry, I know now. I was able to prove that I was not given a dumbing pill.Daniel  Dennett (1991) argues that it might be more interesting to set aside the question of consciousness and simply build the most human robot possible. Robots are becoming more natural both in looks and behavior, and robotics experts hope to make them indistinguishable from humans. Hanson Robotics’ Sophia has cameras in her eyes that allow her to make eye contact and recognize people. She uses Google Chrome voice recognition to process speech, chat with people, and learn. Hiroshi Ishiguro has plans to make his robots suitable for jobs such as a hotel receptionist, a museum tour guide, and a language tutor. Already, 80% of Ishiguro’s participants greeted his robots by saying hello, as they mistakenly believed the robots to be human.Where will this technology lead us? That remains unknown, but the effort to construct artificial consciousness might yield new insights into our own human consciousness.

Is it possible to find consciousness in the brain? Consciousness, the mind, and the brain are like a set of nested Russian dolls. The brain, the outside doll, houses the mind but has other functions as well, such as maintaining breathing and body temperature. The mind, the middle doll, houses consciousness, the innermost doll, but also manages unconscious functions such as long-term memory, discussed in Chapter 9.In this chapter, we will examine a number of natural, artificial, and pathological circumstances that correlate with variations in consciousness. As a result of these investigations, we can begin to view consciousness as requiring complex interactions between areas of the cerebral cortex and the thalamus, discussed in detail in Chapter 4. In particular, lesions of the thalamus result in the type of profound unconsciousness typically associated with brain death (Bogen, 1995). We discuss the concept of brain death more fully in a later section of this chapter.Certain structures in the brain, such as the thalamus, might be necessary, but not sufficient, for consciousness. For example, observing that your television screen no longer produces a picture after you remove a component does not necessarily imply that the sole source of the picture is that particular component; it’s likely that other components need to be attached simultaneously and contribute to the creation of the visual image. Likewise, additional brain structures, such as the reticular formation of the brainstem, play an active role in raising or lowering the thresholds of conscious awareness (see Figure 6.1). Because of these variations, you are far more likely to hear and respond to a sound while awake than while deeply asleep. Structures such as the thalamus and reticular formation have been described as enabling consciousness, but they do not produce its content (Crick & Koch, 2003).Among the brain structures that are believed to participate in consciousness are the cerebral cortex, thalamus, and reticular formation, as well as the complex pathways connecting these parts of the brain. These structures make consciousness possible, which we know because damage to these circuits results in unconsciousness, but they do not determine the content of consciousness.Instead of looking for consciousness as resulting from the activity of particular structures, it is more useful to consider consciousness as resulting from activity changes in brain networks. Neuroscientists initially believed that when your thought is unfocused during a state known as mind wandering, the brain would be quiet, but as you focus on a specific task, the brain would light up. This does not seem to be the case. The brain uses only about 5% more energy when people are focused compared to when they are unfocused (Raichle, 2015; Raichle & Snyder, 2011). These observations have led to the identification of a default mode network (DMN), which maintains a high level of unconscious, background activity as it helps prepare the brain for conscious thought (see Figure 6.2). Activity in the DMN actually decreases a bit when the person engages in a conscious task. One group of researchers was able to predict participants’ mistakes in a computer test by watching the activity of the DMN (Eichele et al., 2008). As much as 30 seconds before a mistake occurred, the DMN would take over, and activity in areas involved with focused attention decreased.Activity of the DMN corresponds to mind wandering, thinking about the self, and preparing for conscious thought.Despite average people spending about 50% of their waking hours in the relatively unfocused mind wandering state managed by the DMN, activity in this network is correlated with feelings of relative unhappiness (Brewer et al., 2011). DMN activity is also correlated with thoughts about the self, which we discuss further in Chapter 12. It is unclear how, or even if, these two correlates of DMN activity interact.Aspect of consciousnessDefinitionExampleState of awarenessThe level of conscious awareness of internal states or surroundings, which can be high or low and realistic or distorted.Asleep or awake.Perceiving realistically or hallucinating.Hypnotized or not.Meditating or not.Content of awarenessThe ongoing catalog of internal and external stimuli that are the focus of current attention.Hearing a neighbor’s music.Thinking that you’re hungry and it’s time to eat.Considering the implications of a news report.Self-awarenessThe special understanding of the self as distinct from other stimuli.Knowing that you are looking at yourself in the mirror.Knowing that you are sleeping and dreaming.

Our first meaning of consciousness involves variations in an animal’s state of awareness. Awareness changes dramatically across cycles of sleepsleepThe components of sleep characterized by theta and delta wave activity, as recorded by electroencephalogram, and deep physical relaxation. The component of sleep characterized by waveforms resembling waking, as measured by electroencephalogram, accompanied by rapid motion of the eyes, muscular paralysis, and sympathetic nervous system activation.

, or daily rhythms. The term circadian comes from the Latin words for about a day.Circadian rhythms are only one example of a number of important biorhythms. Animals have birth seasons and migration patterns. Human females experience menstrual cycles. Within a single day, we also see regular fluctuations in arousal, with peaks occurring every 90 to 120 minutes.

Circadian rhythms respond to a combination of internal and external factors. Internal biological clocksbiological clocksAn internal mechanism that provides an approximate schedule for various physical processes

, controlled by the hypothalamus, provide an approximate schedule for various physical processes, including sleep and waking, body temperature, and hunger. These internal biological clocks interact with external stimuli, known as zeitgebers (zeit means time and geber means to give in German; hence, these stimuli are time givers).Light is one of the most important zeitgebers for humans. Exposure to the rising sun each day helps to reset the internal biological clocks to the correct time. In the absence of light, our internal clocks run a few minutes longer than a 24-hour cycle. Over time, the distortion adds up, and behavior is only occasionally synchronized with normal cycles of day and night. Totally blind people and sailors on submarines experience longer than normal circadian cycles because of their lack of exposure to natural light (Kelly et al., 1999;  Skene, Lockley, & Arendt, 1999).Eating patterns are also significant zeitgebers, as many midnight snackers know. Mice normally sleep during the day and feed at night. However, when mice are fed only during the day, they begin sleeping at night and exploring more during the day (Mieda, Williams, Richardson, Tanaka, & Yanagisawa, 2006).Our human ancestors remained awake during daylight and slept throughout the dark of night, and they lacked the technology needed to travel rapidly across time zones. Technology, particularly the invention of artificial light, has shaped our contemporary sleep–wake patterns by making it easy to be awake at night (see Figure 6.3). Artificial lighting, including that produced by tablets and phones, affects sleep by breaking down melatonin, a hormone released in the evening that regulates sleep cycles. Changes in melatonin release have been implicated in a long list of human diseases, including cancer and heart disease, which are more common among people who work night shifts (Navara & Nelson, 2007).Americans are believed to be somewhat sleep deprived because the average adult spends only 6 hours and 55 minutes in bed, which includes time needed to initiate sleep. Although people try to make up for lost sleep on weekends by sleeping longer, this solution is not very effective.Some occupations, such as hospital and public safety jobs, involve work around the clock, which in turn is correlated with physical and psychological problems. Between 40 and 80% of workers on graveyard shifts (11:00 p.m. to 7:30 a.m.) experience shift maladaptation syndrome, characterized by health, personality, mood, and interpersonal problems (Wagner, 1996). Accident rates in the industrial swing shift (3:00 p.m. to 11:30 p.m.) are higher than in the traditional day shift, and the graveyard shift (11:00 p.m. to 7:30 a.m.) is the most dangerous work period (Hänecke, Tiedemann, Nachreiner, & Grzech-Šukalo, 1998). Not only do shift workers experience more accidents, but they also make more errors. Hospital workers are more likely to make significant errors during evening shifts than during day shifts (Narumi et al., 1999).Our modern ability to cross time zones leads to the experience of jet lag, which produces fatigue, irritability, and sleepiness. The travel is not to blame because north–south travel of equal distance does not produce the symptoms of jet lag (Herxheimer & Waterhouse, 2003). Chronic jet lag has even more serious consequences. Flight attendants with 4 or more years of experience in which time zones were crossed at least once a week had reduced reaction times and made 9% more mistakes on memory tasks than local crews (Cho, Ennaceur, Cole, & Suh, 2000).Some challenges to our circadian rhythms are easier to manage than others. It is easier to adjust when we set the clock to a later point than to an earlier point. The experiences of two people, one traveling from Los Angeles to New York City (setting the clock forward) and the other traveling from New York City to Los Angeles (setting the clock back), are compared in Figure 6.4. Let’s assume that both travelers usually go to bed at 10:00 p.m. and get up at 6:00 a.m. To stay on the same sleep schedule, the LA–NYC traveler must now go to sleep at 7:00 p.m. and wake up at 3:00 a.m., which is difficult, whereas the NYC–LA traveler must stay up until 1:00 a.m. but can sleep until 9:00 a.m., which is easier.Traveling eastward is more disruptive to circadian rhythms than traveling westward. The Los Angeles resident visiting New York feels like he or she is going to bed 3 hours earlier than usual (7:00 p.m. Los Angeles time) and waking up in the middle of the night (3:00 a.m. Los Angeles time). The New Yorker traveling to Los Angeles has to stay up a little later (1:00 a.m. New York time) but then can sleep later to compensate (9:00 a.m. New York time). Most people find the latter scenario easier.Daylight saving time offers another opportunity to observe our responses to abrupt changes in our daily schedules (see Figure 6.5). This energy-saving relic from World War I requires the setting of clocks forward 1 hour in the spring and back 1 hour in the fall. When Canadian traffic accident data were correlated with the two annual daylight saving shifts, the shift back in the fall resulted in a 7% decrease in traffic accidents on the following Monday compared to other fall Mondays. In the spring setting of the clock forward, a comparable 7% increase in traffic accidents occurred (Coren, 1996).Fifteen years of data show that rates of heart attack (a) increase significantly in the days following the spring shift in daylight saving time and (b) decrease following the fall shift. The incidence ratio is computed by comparing the number of heart attacks on the specified day following the shift to the mean number of heart attacks for the same day 2 weeks before and 2 weeks after the shift. The likely reason for the increase is sleep deprivation; it increases sympathetic nervous system activation and inflammation, which can be dangerous to people with existing health problems.When less light is available for setting the body’s internal clocks, approximately 4 to 6% of the population experience major depressive disorder with seasonal patternmajor depressive disorder with seasonal patternA mood disorder in which depression occurs regularly at the same time each year, usually during the winter months; formerly known as seasonal affective disorder (SAD).

, formerly known as seasonal affective disorder (APA, 2013;  Jepson, Ernst, & Kelly, 1998). During the winter months at higher latitudes, the reduction in daylight hours interferes with circadian rhythms. This disruption may lead to symptoms of depression, discussed in more detail in Chapter 14, that lift once the days become longer again. Rates of seasonal depression vary from 1.4% in Florida to 9.7% in New Hampshire (Jepson et al., 1999). Seasonal depression is typically treated by exposure to bright light, with or without melatonin supplements or antidepressant medications. The lights used in this therapy are stronger than what is normally experienced indoors but not as strong as the light at the beach on an August afternoon.You might believe that the day should start around 2:00 p.m., whereas your roommate pops out of bed smiling at an alarming 6:30 in the morning. What accounts for these individual differences in sleep patterns?Some individual differences become evident in infancy and remain consistent over the life span. Morning people have been called larks, and night people have been called owls (Åkerstedt & Fröberg, 1976). Many people fall somewhere between these two extremes and are at their best in the middle of the day. Research on the genetic basis of circadian rhythms suggests that the different patterns result from different versions of the genes responsible for the activity of our internal clocks (Katzenberg et al., 1998).Other differences appear to be more age related. Nearly everyone acts like an owl during adolescence and young adulthood (Carskadon, Wolfson, Acebo, Tzischinsky, & Seifer, 1998). In their mid to late 20s, many temporary owls revert to their previous lark or medium state. The exact cause for such a shift during and after adolescence and young adulthood is unclear, but researchers suspect that the shift correlates with a burst of brain development that is initiated at puberty. Some researchers view the return to a previous sleep pattern in young adulthood as a reliable indicator that the brain is fully mature (Roenneberg et al., 2004).

Varying states of awareness can be described using electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings, which provide a general measure of overall brain activity. During waking, we alternate among three patterns of activity indicated by the recording of beta wavesbeta wavesA waveform of 15 to 30 cycles per second recorded by electroencephalogram that usually indicates alert waking

 in the EEG (see Figure 6.6). During beta activity, a person is actively thinking and alert. Beta activity is characterized by rapid (15 to 30 cycles per second), irregular, low-amplitude waves that indicate the cerebral cortex is processing large amounts of diverse data. A person showing alpha activity is awake but relaxed. Alpha waves are slightly slower, larger, and more regular than beta waves, with a frequency of 9 to 12 cycles per second. Improvements in EEG technology provided the means to record waking waveforms that are faster than 30 cycles per second, known as gamma waves (Miller, 2007). Gamma waves accompany the processing of sensory input, particularly visual stimuli.Modern artificial light breaks down the hormone melatonin, which is released only at night. Disruptions caused by the effects of light on melatonin might be responsible for higher rates of disease, and cancer in particular, among employees who work at night in hospitals.EEG recordings during waking alternate between alpha waves and beta waves. Alpha waves are associated with a relaxed, possibly drowsy state, whereas beta waves are associated with alertness. Gamma waves are seen in response to sensory input.Daydreaming, or mind wandering, refers to spontaneous, subjective experiences in a no-task, no-stimulus, no-response situation (Vaitl et al., 2005, p. 100). Daydreaming is correlated with activity in the DMN, as described earlier in the chapter. EEG studies show that activity in the DMN is most closely correlated with alpha waves (Knyazev, Slobodskoj-Plusnin, Bocharov, & Pylkova, 2011). The function of daydreaming is unclear. We might daydream simply because we evolved the ability to divide our attention, as described in Chapter 5 (Mason et al., 2007). However, during activation of the DMN, we often think about our past experiences and plan our future (Kahn, 2013). This contradicts the commonly held view that daydreaming is a waste of time.Regardless of whether they were larks or owls as children, most teens act like owls by naturally staying up late and sleeping in. Usually by the mid-20s, young adults go back to whichever sleeping pattern they showed before puberty, a change that may mark the final maturity of the brain.

We spend one-third of our lives sleeping. Despite all that experience, few of us know what is going on during sleep. By carefully recording and observing the experience of volunteers sleeping in laboratories, psychologists have been able to unravel many mysteries of sleep.On the basis of observations of sleeping volunteers, we divide sleep into two types: rapid eye movement (REM) sleeprapid eye movement (REM) sleepThe component of sleep characterized by waveforms resembling waking, as measured by electroencephalogram, accompanied by rapid motion of the eyes, muscular paralysis, and sympathetic nervous system activation.

. These types of sleep are differentiated by EEG recordings, muscle tone, autonomic activity, and mental activity (see Figure 6.7).Sleep is divided into two components: rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-REM (N-REM) sleep. The EEG during REM sleep is similar to wakefulness. Stages 1 and 2 of N-REM sleep feature theta waves. Special waveforms known as sleep spindles and K complexes, which might represent the brain’s attempts to tune out environmental stimuli, appear in stage 2. Stages 3 and 4 of N-REM sleep feature delta waves and represent the deepest stages of sleep.N-REM sleep is divided into four stages. Stage 1 usually occurs when we first go to sleep. Our examination of the participant’s EEG shows patterns that are difficult to distinguish from those of the drowsy, waking volunteer. Some theta wavestheta wavesA waveform of four to seven cycles per second recorded by electroencephalogram (EEG) that is characteristic of lighter stages of non–rapid eye movement (N-REM) sleep.

 (4 to 7 cycles per second), which are larger and slower than alpha waves, are now observed. At this stage, people may not be aware that they are sleeping. Frequently, we awaken a friend or a family member who has fallen asleep in front of the television by turning off the program only to have the sleeping person deny being asleep.After 10 to 15 minutes, stage 1 of N-REM sleep gives way to stage 2. Now there is no doubt that the person is asleep. Further reductions in heart rate and muscle tension occur, and the EEG begins to show special waveforms called K complexes and sleep spindles that occur only in sleep. These particular types of activity might reflect the brain’s efforts to keep us asleep while continuing to monitor the external environment. We usually sleep through familiar stimuli, such as the hum of an air conditioner, while waking in response to unexpected stimuli, such as the sound of a door opening.After about 15 minutes in stage 2, we enter stage 3 and then stage 4 N-REM sleep. Both of these stages show delta wavedelta waveA waveform of 1 to 4 cycles per second recorded by electroencephalogram that usually indicates deep non–rapid eye movement sleep.

 activity, which is the largest, slowest (1 to 4 cycles per second) EEG waveform. Stages 3 and 4 differ primarily in the amount of delta activity that occurs, with stage 4 having the most. We are deeply asleep in these stages. Awakening from stage 4 is difficult, and considerable disorientation may occur before a person becomes fully awake. You may have received a telephone call about an hour after you first go to sleep, when you are likely to be experiencing stage 4 N-REM sleep. If you hear the telephone, it may take several seconds to locate the phone and wake up enough to have a decent conversation.College students often neglect sleep time to study, work, and socialize. Sixty percent of students reported staying awake for an entire night at least once since coming to college (Thacher, 2008). Poor sleep habits lead to daytime sleepiness, which can affect how much you learn in your classes, how well you work, and your safety when driving and operating other machinery. How much sleepiness is too much?Try using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale to see how sleepy you tend to be (Johns, 1991). In contrast to just feeling tired, how likely are you to doze off or fall asleep in the situations in the list? Even if you have not done some of these things recently, try to work out how they would have affected you. Use the scale to choose the most appropriate number for each situation. A score greater than 10 indicates excessive daytime sleepiness. If you scored at this level or above, it’s time for some lifestyle changes.The first episode of REM sleep occurs between 90 and 120 minutes after the onset of sleep. This stage is often called paradoxical sleep, reflecting a combination of brain activity resembling waking with the external appearance of deep sleep. During REM sleep, the EEG shows activity similar to waking activity. The eyes make the periodic movements back and forth that give this stage its name. The sympathetic nervous system becomes very active. Heart rate, blood pressure, and breathing become rapid or irregular. Males experience erections, while females experience increased blood flow in the vicinity of the vagina (Hirshkowitz & Moore, 1996). If awakened during this stage, most people report vivid, storylike dreams, which we discuss in more detail in a later section.Major postural muscles are inactive during REM sleep, effectively paralyzing the sleeper, although smaller muscles in the fingers and the toes might twitch. You might have experienced dreams in which something terrible was coming, but you couldn’t move. Your dream probably reflects recognition on the part of the brain that you are paralyzed. This paralysis provides a protective mechanism that prevents you from acting out your dreams. In cases of REM sleep behavior disorder, paralysis fails, and people injure themselves or their sleeping partners. When one patient dreamed of playing football, he knocked everything off his dresser, hit his head against the wall, and banged his knee on the dresser (Schenck, Bundlie, Ettinger, & Mohowald, 2002).Because the body is paralyzed during REM sleep, sleepwalking cannot happen in this stage. Instead, sleepwalking occurs when a person is in stage 3 or 4 of N-REM sleep. Sleep talking is most common during lighter stages of N-REM sleep, but it is also possible during REM sleep. These phenomena become progressively less common with age.The cycling between REM sleep and N-REM sleep in humans follows a characteristic pattern over a period of 8 hours of sleep (see Figure 6.8). The first half of a night’s sleep is characterized by longer periods of N-REM sleep and brief periods of REM sleep. Stages 3 and 4 of N-REM sleep are especially dominant during these first 4 hours. The second half of the night’s sleep switches to a different pattern. REM sleep is now dominant, and N-REM sleep remains in the lighter stages. Stages 3 and 4 may be infrequent or absent during the last 4 hours of sleep. We usually spend the last half hour or so of the night’s sleep in REM sleep and often wake up with the awareness that we have been dreaming.SituationChance of dozingSitting and readingWatching televisionSitting inactive in a public place (e.g., a theater)Riding as a car passenger for an hour without a breakLying down to rest in the afternoonSitting and talking to someoneSitting quietly after lunch without alcoholIn a car, while stopping for a few minutes in trafficTOTAL SCORE0 = Would never doze1 = Slight chance of dozing2 = Moderate chance of dozing3 = High chance of dozingHuman error, and sleep deprivation in particular, frequently contributes to major accidents and disasters. The 1979 nuclear meltdown at Three Mile Island changed the power industry in the United States. The 1986 explosion of the space shuttle Challenger rattled confidence in the U.S. space program. The 1989 oil spill caused by the running aground of the tanker Exxon Valdez energized concerns about environmental protection. More recently, the operator of a commuter train that ran off the tracks up an escalator at Chicago O’Hare International Airport admitted to dozing off.Sleep shows a typical progression over the night. The first 4 hours are dominated by N-REM sleep, and most stage 3 and 4 N-REM sleep occurs at this time. The second 4 hours feature large amounts of REM sleep.Although we still have many unanswered questions about why we spend one-third of our lives sleeping, we know that lack of sleep can have many negative effects. Excess sleepiness on the part of decision makers has contributed to many disasters, including the Three Mile Island nuclear meltdown, the Challenger space shuttle explosion, and the grounding of the oil tanker Exxon Valdez (Coren, 2012). In 2014, a commuter train at Chicago’s O’Hare airport controlled by an operator who admitted to dozing off ran off the tracks and climbed an escalator. Staying awake for 17 to 19 straight hours produces worse reaction time than being legally drunk (Williamson & Feyer, 2000). Sleep deprivation can result in obesity and risk for type 2 diabetes (Benedict et al., 2016).Sleep, and in particular stages 3 and 4 of N-REM sleep, plays an important role in repairing the body. Sleep deprivation slows the healing of injuries (Murphy et al., 2007), reduces the activity of the immune system (Zager, Andersen, Ruiz, Antunes, & Tufik, 2007), and results in the production of fewer new neurons in adult brains (Guzmán-Marín et al., 2003). Nearly all human growth hormone, which plays important roles in repairing the body, is released during stages 3 and 4 of N-REM sleep but rarely during other stages of sleep and waking (Savine & Sönksen, 2000) (see Figure 6.9). Another line of evidence supporting the restorative hypothesis of sleep is the behavior of people following intense physical activity. Runners competing in ultramarathons (races that are twice the length of a normal marathon) experience greater amounts of N-REM sleep the night after their performance.Human growth hormone stimulates growth and repair. Most human growth hormone release occurs during the first 4 hours of sleep each night, primarily during stages 3 and 4 of N-REM sleep. The drop in time spent in stages 3 and 4 among older adults might contribute to reduced abilities to heal compared to those of younger adults.It is possible to selectively deprive volunteers in a sleep laboratory of stage 3 and 4 N-REM sleep. After a night of such deprivation, volunteers typically complain of muscle and joint pain (Moldofsky & Scarisbrick, 1976). Because time spent in N-REM sleep decreases about 30 minutes per decade after the age of 50 (Van Cauter, Leproult, & Plat, 2000), it is possible that reduced N-REM sleep is the source of some of the muscle and joint aches and pains experienced by older adults.Sleep plays a significant role in memory. Staying up all night results in poor memory performance, and two subsequent nights of normal sleep do not make up for the initial sleep deprivation effects (Stickgold & Walker, 2007). Sleep may serve as a special state for consolidating memories, in contrast to the acquisition and initial processing of new memories that occurs during waking (Rasch & Born, 2013). During N-REM sleep, memories are reactivated and transformed into versions that can be stored in long-term memory (see Chapter 9). REM sleep stabilizes the newly transformed memories. Students who wish to retain the material they’ve studied would be well advised to get a good night’s sleep (Mazza et al., 2016).Birds and mammals are the only creatures to show clear evidence of REM sleep, suggesting that this sleep stage is a fairly recent development in the course of evolution. When volunteers are specifically deprived of REM sleep, they show many of the same symptoms as people who experience an overall lack of sleep, including irritability and difficulty concentrating. In addition, REM sleep-deprived individuals show a phenomenon known as REM rebound (Dement, 1960). When allowed to sleep normally, they spend an unusually large amount of their sleep time in REM sleep. You may have experienced REM rebound during a nap following a night with little sleep. You might be aware of having dreamed vividly during the nap, and you’re unlikely to feel rested. These attempts to make up for lost REM sleep suggest that REM sleep has a necessary function in the adult brain.One clue to a possible function of REM sleep is the fact that the proportion of sleep spent in REM sleep is a function of a species’ relative maturity at birth (Siegel, 2001). The human infant, born at an immature stage of brain development relative to other primate species, spends about half of its sleep time in REM sleep (see Figure 6.10), compared to the 20% of sleep time spent in REM sleep by adolescents and adults (McCarley, 2007). Premature infants spend up to 80% of their sleep time in REM sleep. REM sleep may provide at least part of the stimulation necessary to correctly wire the immature brain (Marks, Shaffery, Oksenberg, Speciale, & Roffwarg, 1995).Infants and young children spend greater percentages of their sleep time in REM sleep than do adolescents and adults, suggesting that brain activity during REM sleep might help wire the developing brain.REM sleep and mood are tightly interwoven, providing us with a further clue regarding the possible functions of REM sleep. As we will see in Chapter 14, individuals with depression experience disruptions in their normal sleep patterns. Without treatment, they enter REM sleep earlier in the night than typical participants do, and they spend a greater proportion of their sleeping time in REM sleep. One of the possible mechanisms by which antidepressant medications regulate mood is their suppression of REM sleep. Individuals with bipolar disorder, which is characterized by moods that swing from euphoria to depression, experience an abnormally low need for sleep.These correlations between REM sleep and mood may represent a common underlying biochemical mechanism. Brainstem neurons that release serotonin and norepinephrine are especially quiet during REM sleep, although they are active during waking and somewhat active during N-REM sleep (Gottesman, 2002). These same neurotransmitters have also been implicated in the regulation of mood states, which helps explain links between REM sleep and mood.From the earliest times in our history, people have searched for the significance and meaning of their dreams. In ancient Egypt, many people believed that dreams predicted the future. In his classic book The Interpretation of Dreams, Freud (1900/1953) argued that the unconscious mind expressed itself symbolically through our dreams. These are interesting ideas, but what does science have to say about dreamingdreamingA mental state that usually occurs during sleep that features visual imagery.

?The use of EEG technology to track a volunteer’s sleep patterns allowed researchers to awaken volunteers and assess a dream experience scientifically for the first time (Aserinsky & Kleitman, 1953;  Dement & Kleitman, 1957). Improved methods, including brain imaging, magnetic stimulation, and improved EEG, have produced further insights into dreaming (Cipolli, Ferrara, De Gennaro, & Plazzi, 2016). Rather than proposing sharp distinctions between dreaming during sleep and other types of thought, dream activity is seen as being on a continuum extending across focused thought and mind wandering during wakefulness to thought-like and dream-like behaviors during sleep.An activation–synthesis theory of dreaming suggests that the content of dreams simply reflects ongoing neural activity. For example, dreams of being unable to move in a dangerous situation might accurately mirror the muscle paralysis present during the REM state (Hobson & McCarley, 1977). Common dreams of flying or falling may be caused by the unusual activation of the vestibular system during REM sleep (Hunt, 1989). In Chapter 5, we discussed the vestibular system’s role in helping us maintain balance. Dreams with sexual content are consistent with the physical sexual arousal that occurs during REM sleep. Combining results of brain imaging experiments and cognitive psychology leads to yet another view of dreams. Dreaming behavior correlates with activity in circuits that overlap substantially with the DMN (Fox, Nijeboer, Solomonova, Domhoff, & Christoff, 2013). According to this view, daydreaming and dreaming during sleep are on a continuum. Simultaneous changes in brainstem activity result in lower sensitivity to outside stimuli, and reduced overall frontal lobe activity might lead to less self-awareness and logical thought than occurs during daydreaming. Once the dream state is initiated, the brain draws on memories of general knowledge and personal experience to produce a story line (Foulkes, 1999).Most of us are aware that mood and stress can have negative impacts on our sleep, but it might surprise you that loneliness can be a problem for good sleep quality too. Understanding the impact of loneliness on sleep helps explain some of the negative health outcomes associated with feeling socially disconnected. For example, loneliness in older adults predicted lower rates of survival 6 years later in the United States (Luo et al., 2012) and in China (Luo & Waite, 2014). You might think that loneliness affects people by making them less likely to follow good health habits, such as taking their medication and exercising, but research didn’t support this hypothesis. Instead, researchers suspected that loneliness led to poor health in part by disrupting sleep, which plays an important role in healing the body (Cacioppo et al., 2002).The Question: Is sleep quality affected by loneliness?Sixty-four undergraduates at Ohio State University participated in the study. Their levels of perceived loneliness were assessed using the Revised UCLA (University of California, Los Angeles; UCLA-R) Loneliness Scale (Russell, Peplau, & Cutrona, 1980). Their sleep quality was measured using a sleep monitor called Nightcap while they spent the night in the campus’s Clinical Research Center. Sleep quality measures included sleep onset, sleep duration, number of awakenings, and wake time after onset. The participants’ sleep quality was assessed 2 weeks later at home over five consecutive nights.Sleeping while monitored might cause the study participants some discomfort, but the most significant ethical concern in this research is the assessment of depression and loneliness. Because of the need to preserve participant confidentiality, the researchers would not be able to match depression and loneliness scores to individuals, which would allow them to warn those who needed treatment. Instead, the researchers would need to include referrals to services in their informed consent form, hoping that individuals who needed help would seek it.The participants were divided into high-, medium-, and low-loneliness groups on the basis of their scores on the UCLA-R Loneliness Scale. Sleep quality did vary significantly among these groups, with the high-loneliness group experiencing the lowest sleep quality and the low-loneliness group experiencing the best sleep quality. The medium-loneliness group had sleep quality scores between these two extremes. In particular, the loneliest participants were more likely to experience restless sleep, as indicated by their spending more time awake during the night after they had fallen asleep once.The results of this study indicated that lonely people experienced poor quality of sleep. However, there are several ways these results could be explained, as we outlined in Chapter 2. First, it is possible that the experience of loneliness causes poor sleep quality. Second, poor sleep quality could interfere with a person’s ability to function well socially, leading to loneliness. Third, loneliness and sleep quality could influence each other reciprocally. Finally, some third variable or set of variables could lead to both disruptions of feeling socially connected and sleep quality. If you think that a likely candidate for one of these third variables is depression, the researchers controlled for this by assessing depression before the study and excluding potential participants who appeared to be depressed. In addition, these various interpretations were tested in a subsequent longitudinal study. Loneliness was found to decrease sleep quality, and neither sleep quality nor any third variable that was tested (e.g., depressive symptoms) was found to influence loneliness (see review by  Cacioppo et al., 2015).These results indicate that the relationships between loneliness and health involve neural mechanisms and are not simply the result of the likelihood that an individual follows good health behaviors.The activation-synthesis theory of dream content suggests that the content of dreams represents the mind’s efforts to make sense out of real physical sensations. During REM sleep, the vestibular system of the inner ear is quite active. Because the vestibular system normally informs us about the position and movement of the head, vestibular activity during REM sleep might lead to the commonly experienced dreams of flying or falling.In lucid dreaminglucid dreamingA conscious awareness of dreaming accompanied by the ability to control the content of the dream

, dreamers become aware that they are dreaming and may use this awareness to control or direct the content of the dream. This improved insight during REM sleep is associated with increased activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, an area of the brain believed to participate in higher-order executive functions, including people’s sense of control and voluntary behavior (Dresler et al., 2013). Lucid dreaming occurs when frontal areas of the brain inexplicably wake up during a dream (Mota-Rolim & Araujo, 2013).

Observing what goes wrong in sleep provides additional insights into the natural variations of consciousness we experience.When the content of a REM dream is especially upsetting, we refer to the experience as a nightmare. If lucid dreamers become stuck in a nightmare, they may have the option of changing channels and exiting that line of content. Some researchers report that training in lucid dreaming may serve as an effective treatment for recurring, upsetting nightmares (Mota-Rolim & Araujo, 2013;  Zadra & Pihl, 1997).Nightmares are often mistaken for sleep terrorssleep terrorsA sleep disorder occurring in non–rapid eye movement sleep in which the sleeper wakes suddenly in great distress but without experiencing the imagery of a nightmare
    
        sleep terrors
        A sleep disorder occurring in non–rapid eye movement sleep in which the sleeper wakes suddenly in great distress but without experiencing the imagery of a nightmare
        
    
, but they are different phenomena. Nightmares are dreams that occur during REM sleep, while sleep terrors occur during N-REM sleep, particularly during the first 3 hours of sleep. In sleep terrors, the usually smooth transition from stage 4 N-REM sleep upward into REM sleep goes awry. The sleeper becomes acutely distressed despite remaining deeply asleep. If awakened, the person shows the disorientation and confusion typically demonstrated when a sleeper is disturbed during deep N-REM sleep. There is usually no memory of the sleep terror the next day. Twin studies suggest that there is a genetic predisposition to sleep terrors (Taheri & Mignot, 2002).After nightmares, the most common sleep problem is insomniainsomniaA sleep disorder characterized by an inability to either initiate or maintain normal sleep.

, in which a person has difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep. Although most people seem to need about 7 to 9 hours of sleep per night to function effectively, wider healthy variations exist. In one case of healthy insomnia, an elderly woman slept only 1 hour per night without apparent detrimental effects (Meddis, Pearson, & Langford, 1973).Insomnia occurs in one of two forms. In cases of onset insomnia, a person lies in bed for what seems to be a long period but is unable to go to sleep. Stress and anxiety are frequent causes of this type of insomnia. Maintenance insomnia occurs when sleep is frequently interrupted or early waking occurs. These cases typically result from stress, substance use, or psychological disorders. Insomnia medications, such as zolpidem (Ambien), have minor effects on sleep, producing sleep 15 minutes faster and lengthening it for about 30 minutes, which might not offset significant side effects, including dependence on the medication, driving or walking while asleep, memory loss, and loss of coordination (Buscemi et al., 2007).Because light can interfere with the sleep hormone melatonin, the use of tablets and smartphones right before bed can interfere with sleep quality. Fortunately, exposure to daylight sun for a few hours is enough to offset any negative effects of the later light exposure (Rångtell et al., 2016).Probably the most dramatic sleep disorder is narcolepsynarcolepsyA sleep disorder characterized by the intrusion of rapid eye movement phenomena into waking
    
        narcolepsy
        A sleep disorder characterized by the intrusion of rapid eye movement phenomena into waking
        
    
. Narcolepsy consists of sleep attacks, in which REM sleep occurs during wakefulness (Dahl, Holttum, & Trubnick, 1994). In addition to sleep attacks, other aspects of REM sleep may intrude into the wakefulness of patients with narcolepsy. Cataplexy occurs when the muscle paralysis normally associated with REM sleep occurs during wakefulness without loss of consciousness. Many patients with narcolepsy also experience sleep paralysis or muscle paralysis that either precedes actual sleep or lingers once the person has awakened. Although upsetting, this paralysis is easy to resolve. Simply touching the person is enough to end the paralysis.Brain imaging can be used to compare activity during waking with activity during sleep. In this image, areas that are blue or purple are less active during REM sleep than during waking, and areas that are red or yellow are more active during REM sleep than during waking. The bizarre content of dreams occurring during REM sleep might be the result of the lower activity in the frontal lobes (purple) at the top of the image. The visual vividness of dreams might be accounted for by the higher amount of activity in the visual areas of the occipital lobes toward the bottom of the image (yellow and red).Cells in the hypothalamus that normally secrete neurochemicals known as orexins are missing or damaged in the brains of patients with narcolepsy (Thannickal et al., 2000). Although researchers have been able to selectively breed for narcolepsy in dogs (Foutz, Mitler, Cavalli-Sforza, & Dement, 1978), the contribution of genetics to human narcolepsy is more complex. Narcolepsy results from a combination of genetic vulnerability and autoimmune processes that attack the cells in the brain that produce orexins (Taheri & Mignot, 2002). These autoimmune processes are likely triggered by exposure to flu viruses (Dauvilliers et al., 2013;  Partinen et al., 2014).We take it for granted that automatic functions such as breathing continue uninterrupted during sleep, but this is not the case in sleep apneasleep apneaA sleep disorder in which the person stops breathing while asleep
    
        sleep apnea
        A sleep disorder in which the person stops breathing while asleep
        
    
. In a person with sleep apnea, breathing can stop for a minute or two, and the sleeper awakens abruptly gasping for air. Not only does this lack of air disrupt the sleep quality of the person with sleep apnea, but it can increase the risk for heart disease (Kendzerska, Gershon, Hawker, Leung, & Tomlinson, 2014). Because most cases of sleep apnea occur in people who are obese and who snore (obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea), losing weight and surgical correction of airway blockages are common treatments. Other cases occur when brainstem neurons responsible for maintaining breathing during sleep malfunction (central sleep apnea). In these cases, the use of a machine that regulates airflow during sleep is an inconvenient but effective solution.Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)A sleep disorder in which an otherwise healthy infant dies while asleep
    
        Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)
        A sleep disorder in which an otherwise healthy infant dies while asleep
        
    
, occurs when a healthy infant simply dies while asleep. Approximately 3,500 infants die from SIDS in the United States each year (Moon & Task Force on Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, 2016). Rates prior to the 1990s were even higher. Between 1992 and 2003, rates of SIDS in the United States were cut in half when the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) began telling parents to put their infants to sleep on their backs instead of on their stomachs (NICHHD, 2003). As we will see in Chapter 11, young infants cannot turn over easily for the first few months of life, making suffocation on blankets and stuffed animals a greater risk.Despite her suspected narcolepsy, Harriet Tubman (1820–1913) helped hundreds of slaves escape through the Underground Railroad during the Civil War era. Tubman appears on the left in this photo with some of the former slaves whom she helped. Unfortunately, narcoleptic attacks are often brought on by stress. Tubman had a number of close escapes when she experienced sleep attacks while being pursued by Confederate troops and irate slave owners.Findings that new narcolepsy cases resulted from either infection with or vaccination for the H1N1 flu virus support the idea that narcolepsy is linked to activity in the immune system. American vaccines provoking weaker immune responses were less likely to result in narcolepsy than stronger European vaccines and the disease itself (Dauvilliers et al., 2013;  Dauvilliers et al., 2010).Despite these improvements, SIDS remains the most common cause of death in the first 6 months of life in industrialized nations, even as the cause of these cases remains elusive (Krous, 2014). Although some cases might include biological vulnerabilities in serotonin function (Paterson et al., 2006), most affected infants have additional risk factors, such as exposure to tobacco smoke (Ostfeld, Esposito, Perl, & Hegyi, 2010). Current recommendations for preventing SIDS from the American Academy of Pediatrics include putting infants to sleep on their backs; using a firm sleep surface; room-sharing without bed-sharing; avoidance of soft bedding and overheating; avoidance of exposure to smoke, alcohol, and illicit drugs; breastfeeding; routine immunization; use of pacifiers; and skin-to-skin care for newborns (Moon & Task Force on Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, 2016).Restless legs syndrome (RLS)Restless legs syndrome (RLS)A disorder characterized by the involuntary movement of an extremity, usually one leg
    
        Restless legs syndrome (RLS)
        A disorder characterized by the involuntary movement of an extremity, usually one leg
        
    
, occurs when one of a person’s limbs, usually a leg, experiences a tingling feeling and moves at regular intervals. RLS appears to be quite common, with 15% of a large sample of adults in the United States reporting these symptoms (National Sleep Foundation, 2009). RLS results from a gene variant that is active only during early prenatal development in the basal ganglia, a part of the brain involved with voluntary movement (Spieler et al., 2014) (see Chapter 4). Of special interest to psychologists is the high frequency of RLS among children and adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and the potential genetic links between these two conditions (Schimmelmann et al., 2009). As we will see in Chapter 14, ADHD is correlated with differences in dopamine functioning, a characteristic shared by RLS (Taheri & Mignot, 2002).Sleep researcher Emmanuel Mignot is holding Bear, one of his dogs with narcolepsy. Research with dogs like Bear showed that narcolepsy is a genetic disorder often triggered by exposure to flu viruses. Sadly, Bear passed away in 2014.The number of deaths from SIDS dropped dramatically when the American Academy of Pediatrics began telling parents in 2003 to put their babies to sleep on their backs instead of on their stomachs. SIDS still occurs, however, so sleeping position is only one of many risk factors, including exposure to cigarette smoke in the home.Stage of waking or sleepBrain activity recorded by EEGObservationsWakingAlpha, beta, gammaAlternating periods of alertness and relaxation.Logical thought.Voluntary movement.Responsive to stimuli.N-REM sleepStage 1Some thetaLogical thought.Reduced heart rate and muscle tension.Some responsiveness to stimuli.Stage 2Larger amounts of thetaLess responsiveness to stimuli.Further reductions in heart rate and muscle tension.Stage 3Some deltaFurther reductions in heart rate and muscle tension.Stage 4Larger amounts of deltaProfound reductions in heart rate and muscle tension.Very low responsiveness to stimuli.REM sleepSimilar to wakingRapid motion of the eyes.Muscle paralysis.Irregular autonomic activity.Vivid dreams.

If consciousness is a function of the brain, we should be able to identify aspects of consciousness that change reliably when the brain is damaged.

Lessons about consciousness have emerged from the clinical study of patients with damage to specific parts of the nervous system.The effects of brain damage on face recognition illustrate how the brain integrates sensory information, memory, and emotion to form a conscious experience. Prosopagnosia is a condition that affects a person’s ability to recognize faces (Bauer, 1984). One patient was unable to identify familiar faces but was still able to show differing autonomic responses to familiar versus unfamiliar faces. Separate pathways process the features of faces, emotional responses to faces, and recognition of faces.Prosopagnosia results from damage to a part of the temporal lobes on the bottom of the brain known as the fusiform face area (FFA). In this scan using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the FFA activity indicates that the person is looking at the image of a face as opposed to a landscape or building.In a situation that is reminiscent of many horror film classics, patients with Capgras syndrome are convinced that imposters have taken the place of familiar people. In certain tragic instances, patients with Capgras even try to harm the imposters. Capgras syndrome and prosopagnosia produce opposite effects. In Capgras syndrome, the ability to recognize faces remains intact, but the sense of emotion and familiarity is distorted. The damage associated with Capgras syndrome is not thoroughly understood, but it probably involves connections between visual areas of the brain and the amygdala (Ramachandran, 1998).

Consciousness is altered not only by damage in particular areas of the brain but by the severity of damage as well.Our word coma comes from the Greek word for deep sleep. Coma produces a profound state of unconsciousness in which the person does not have sleep–wake cycles, cannot be awakened, does not respond to pain or light, and is incapable of voluntary behavior. Coma results from damage to both cerebral hemispheres or to the reticular formation (Liversedge & Hirsch, 2010). A stroke affecting a single hemisphere typically does not lead to coma. Comas last anywhere from a few days to several weeks. After a period of 2 to 4 weeks, most patients recover, move into a vegetative state (described later in this section), or die. Among those who recover, improvement is usually slow and gradual.EEG recordings of comatose patients vary depending on the problem that initially led to coma. Following resuscitation from cardiac arrest, many patients show a distinctive pattern of alpha rhythms, especially in the frontal lobes, known as alpha coma (Chatrian, 1990). These alpha patterns do not change when the patient is exposed to various types of stimulation. Other patterns feature a low level of overall activity occasionally interrupted by spikes. None of these patterns are found in the typical, healthy EEG described previously in our section on sleep and waking (see Figure 6.11).Even though the patient with the normal EEG recording is drowsy, which should produce a dominant pattern of alpha waves, the normal recording is quite different from the more uniform alpha activity recorded from a patient in a coma.Coma can be distinguished from similar conditions, such as vegetative state (VS)vegetative state (VS)An abnormal state following brain injury featuring wakefulness without consciousness.

 and brain death. VS often follows a period of coma. VS is characterized by waking without consciousness. In contrast to the patient with coma, patients with VS look rather normal. Their eyes open periodically, and they grind their teeth, scream, smile, or cry. Some are responsive to pain. The presence of conscious awareness in VS remains debatable (Celesia, 2013; see Figure 6.12).Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a small number of patients in a vegetative state (VS) showed brain activation to specific tasks that closely resembled the activation of healthy control participants. The yellow-red areas were active when thinking about movement, and the bluish areas were active when thinking about a spatial task. This research emphasizes the need to develop new ways of assessing the cognitive correlates of brain injuries so that patients can receive the best care possible.With the advent of technologies that can artificially maintain bodily functions, including respiration and blood circulation, we have been placed in the odd position of requiring a new definition of death. Brain death is now defined as a complete and irreversible lack of measurable brain activity, as evidenced by two flatline EEG recordings taken 24 hours apart or lack of blood circulation to the brain (see Figure 6.13). In brain death, the patient shows no responses to external stimuli, including pain, and no reflexes related to the cranial nerves described in Chapter 4.Brain death is often determined by a study of blood circulation. In this image, blood can be seen flowing into the neck, scalp, and face (particularly the nose, which leads to the phrase hot nose sign). However, no blood flow is seen in the brain itself, which remains dark. A careful determination of brain death is required because of the common practice of organ donation following death.Because of improvements in technology that literally bring people back to life, more than 8 million Americans have reported a near-death experiencenear-death experienceAn altered state of consciousness reported by people who were close to death because of cardiac or other medical problems that features out-of-body experiences, light-at-the-end-of-a-tunnel perceptions, and a state of calmness

 (Mauro, 1992). Patients who recover following a cardiac arrest or some other life-threatening condition often report similar experiences. These experiences typically feature an out-of-body experience in which people feel they are viewing their body from a floating position above it. In addition, many people report a light at the end of the tunnel visual experience, which may include images of deceased friends, relatives, or deities. These visual sensations are accompanied by a peaceful, calm emotional state and followed by a reluctant return to the body.The similarities among documented cases of near-death experiences suggest that the dying-revival experience produces consistent responses in the human brain (Negovsky & Gurvitch, 1995). In animal models of cardiac arrest, a surge of brain activity occurs near death, suggesting a state of heightened consciousness (Borjigin et al., 2013). Strong out-of-body sensations and other near-death phenomena occur in volunteers using ketamine (Jansen, 1996). A damaged brain may release its own chemicals, similar to ketamine, in an effort to minimize cell loss.

 are uncontrolled electrical disturbances in the brain that often produce changes in consciousness, providing further evidence that cortical activity is correlated with consciousness. People with recurring seizures are diagnosed with epilepsy. Seizures occur as a result of brain injury or infection but can also appear without an obvious cause. Disturbances in the activity of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA might account for many seizures. Drugs that inhibit GABA reliably produce seizures, while drugs that enhance GABA activity, such as barbiturates, prevent or control seizures.Seizures are classified as partial or generalized. Partial seizures originate in a particular part of the brain known as the focal area and are often accompanied by an aura or a premonition that a seizure is about to occur. Generalized seizures do not arise from a focal area. Instead, these seizures are characterized by the abnormal activation of circuits connecting the cortex and the thalamus. Generalized seizures are typically not accompanied by an aura (see Figure 6.14).(a) Partial seizures originate in a focal area and spread to cortical and subcortical structures. (b) Generalized seizures do not originate in a focal area. Once they begin, generalized seizures spread through the brain symmetrically via connections between the thalamus and the cortex.Partial seizures originating in the temporal lobe often produce distortions of consciousness, leading to the experience of déjà vu (French for already seen), a feeling that one is reliving the past, or jamais vu (French for never seen), a sense that one’s familiar circumstances are suddenly foreign or strange. Consciousness is lost in generalized seizures. The two major categories of generalized seizure are tonic-clonic and absence seizures. Tonic-clonic seizures begin with a loss of consciousness, cessation of breathing, and intense muscular contraction. This phase usually gives way to violent, rhythmic contractions that may result in broken bones or other physical injuries. These phases are followed by a period of coma, lasting about 5 minutes. In an absence seizure, the person loses consciousness and awareness of surroundings, and motor movements are limited to blinking, head turns, and eye movements.

Humans have intentionally altered consciousness in religious, recreational, and healing contexts. Methods may vary dramatically, but we will see that some common themes of these efforts emerge. Individuals who deliberately alter their state of consciousness may be seeking insight, positive emotion (bliss or ecstasy), or a sense of unity or oneness. The universality of such efforts, which often underlie religious behavior, strongly suggests that these states confer some advantages, although what those advantages may be remains unknown.

Historically, humans have gone to great lengths to obtain psychoactive drugspsychoactive drugsAny drug with the capability of altering a person’s state of consciousness.

, or substances that alter consciousness. Humans may be unique among animals in their willingness to voluntarily seek alterations in consciousness through the deliberate use of psychoactive substances. Most psychoactive substances are quite poisonous (livestock eating tobacco leaves in the field will die) and usually have the bitter taste associated with most poisons. On the rare occasions when nonhuman animals consume psychoactive substances (cats and catnip or elephants and alcohol), we have no way of knowing whether this consumption is motivated by a desire to alter consciousness.Before exploring commonly used drugs, we will outline several general principles related to their use, including tolerance, withdrawal, and addiction.Most animals avoid psychoactive substances, but this Swedish moose managed to get stuck in a tree after eating fermented apples that had fallen on the ground. We have no way of knowing whether the moose was motivated by a desire to experience an altered state of consciousness or it simply liked the taste of the fruit.ToleranceToleranceThe need to administer greater quantities of a drug to achieve the same subjective effect
    
        Tolerance

 occurs when a person must take larger quantities of a drug to produce the desired effects. The nervous system seeks to maintain homeostasis, a steady internal balance or equilibrium discussed further in Chapter 7. When a person takes a drug repeatedly, the nervous system attempts to compensate for the drug’s effects. These compensations are both biological and learned (via mechanisms described in more detail in Chapter 8).When some habitually used drugs are no longer available, the user might experience withdrawalwithdrawalPhysical responses to the removal of some habitually administered drugs

, a set of effects that are the opposite of those produced by the drug. Withdrawing from alcohol, which inhibits the nervous system, produces a rebound effect characterized by so much excess brain activity that life-threatening seizures often occur. Withdrawing from stimulants such as caffeine can make the user sluggish and lethargic. Not all drugs that are abused produce significant withdrawal. For example, heroin and nicotine produce powerful withdrawal effects, but cocaine usually does not (Coffey, Dansky, Carrigan, & Brady, 2000).AddictionAddictionA compulsive physical or psychological dependence on a substance or activity that continues in spite of negative consequences.

 is a compulsive physical or psychological dependence on a substance or activity that continues in spite of negative consequences. Although tolerance and withdrawal are two hallmark symptoms of physical dependence on a drug, not all addictive drugs display these features. For example, cocaine is quite addictive despite its lack of withdrawal symptoms. The defining features of an addiction are the compulsive repetition of drug use or an activity and the inability to abstain from the addictive behavior despite serious negative consequences. Addiction overwhelms normal control of behavior, distorts typical systems of reward, and interferes with the recognition of problems.Should we be concerned about military veterans returning from service in Afghanistan with opium addictions? If the experiences of returning Vietnam veterans are repeated, the answer will be no. Even though heroin was readily available in Vietnam and large numbers of soldiers used heroin while serving, nearly all quit using upon their return to the United States. These observations remind us that addiction is a complex phenomenon with multiple causes.In addiction, people make choices on the basis of short-term outcomes (getting high) instead of on the basis of long-term outcomes (family, finances, job, and staying out of jail). This disruption in normal, logical decision making can occur because of distortions in one or more of three related neural systems: an impulsive system involving dopamine pathways connecting the midbrain and the basal ganglia, a reflective system in the frontal lobes that weighs the pros and the cons of a decision and controls impulses, and a craving system involving the insula (Noël, Brevers, & Bechara, 2013) (see Figure 6.15). Activity in the insula is correlated with participants’ craving for their drug of choice, and strokes that damage the insula eliminate the urge to use some addictive drugs (Verdejo-Garcia, Clark, & Dunn, 2012). Excess activity in the impulsive system, inadequate activity in the reflective system, and increased desire appear to set the stage for maintaining compulsive addictive behaviors.Addiction is correlated with activity in a number of brain circuits. (a) An impulsive, reward-seeking system that uses the neurochemical dopamine connects the midbrain (ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra) with the basal ganglia, including the nucleus accumbens. A reflective system involving the frontal lobes controls impulses and makes decisions. (b) A craving system involves the insula.

Cannabis, from the Cannabis sativa plant, has a long human history. It was included in the pharmacy written by Chinese emperor Shen Neng nearly 5,000 years ago. Marijuana, the smoked form of cannabis, remains the most commonly used federally illegal substance in the United States today. The behavioral effects of cannabis are often so subtle that people may report no changes in response to its use. Most individuals experience some excitation, vivid imagery, and mild euphoria. Others respond with depression and social withdrawal. At somewhat higher doses, cannabis produces hallucinations, leading to its formal classification as a hallucinogenhallucinogenA drug that stimulates the experience of false perceptions

.Cannabis contains more than 50 psychoactive compounds, known as cannabinoids. The most important of these is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). THC produces some of its behavioral effects by interacting with receptors for endogenous cannabinoids, natural substances that are similar to THC in chemical composition. One type of cannabinoid receptor is located in parts of the brain involved with pain, appetite, learning, reasoning, and movement (see Figure 6.16). Another type is found elsewhere in the body, particularly in structures associated with the immune system.Cannabinoids, such as THC, interact with receptors located in a number of parts of the brain. In particular, cannabinoid receptors are numerous in the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex.Our main endogenous cannabinoid, anandamide, removes unnecessary memories and slows movement, leading to relaxation. Unlike THC, though, anandamide’s effects last only briefly. Anandamide acts by preventing the inhibition of dopamine release by other neurochemicals. In other words, anandamide promotes dopamine activity. Because THC shares anandamide’s ability to stimulate dopamine activity, cannabis has the potential to produce dependency (Merritt, Martin, Walters, Lichtman, & Damaj, 2008).As this textbook goes to press, 29 states and the District of Columbia in the United States have laws allowing the recreational or medicinal use of marijuana (cannabis) (See Figure 6.17). Other states have decriminalized the possession of small amounts. Cannabis is already commonly used, with about 5 million daily users worldwide (Radhakrishnan, Wilkinson, & D’Souza, 2015). In spite of its common use, scientific investigations into cannabis effects are surprisingly underdeveloped (Choo & Emery, 2016).Use of marijuana (cannabis) is legal in 29 states and the District of Columbia in the United States, making a scientific understanding of its effects a priority.Scientists express mixed opinions regarding the health outcomes of using cannabis, as many variables play significant roles, such as potency of drug used, age at when use begins, extent of use, and individual genetic factors. In general, however, several public health concerns have been raised: impairment of learning and memory (even when nonintoxicated), decreased motivation, and risk for psychosis (Volkow et al., 2016).Perhaps the most controversial of these possible outcomes is the relationship between cannabis and psychosis, including schizophrenia (see Chapter 14). Evidence for a positive correlation between adolescent cannabis use and psychosis is quite strong (Volkow et al., 2016), but as you know from your study of Chapter 2, correlations do not give us the ability to point to causes. So while it might be true that cannabis use is a risk factor for psychosis, it is also quite possible that people who are prodromal, or heading in the direction of developing psychosis without yet showing full symptoms, are more likely to use cannabis. Complex interactions might occur, in which people with a particular genotype (see Chapter 3) or who smoke tobacco first, and then use cannabis, might be more vulnerable to psychosis (Gage & Munafò, 2015).Given the consequences of psychosis for public health, it is important for researchers to take an objective, unemotional look at this issue to provide individuals with the evidence they need to make informed choices.In 1938, researcher Albert Hoffman reported some unusual sensations after working with lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). Hoffman deliberately ingested some of the chemical and reported vivid, colorful visual hallucinations.LSD is chemically similar to serotonin, and it interacts with serotonin receptors (Gonzalez-Maeso et al., 2008; Gonzalez-Maeso et al., 2007). LSD’s ability to produce hallucination remains poorly understood. One of the interesting cognitive outcomes of LSD use is the experience of flashbacks, intrusive and involuntary hallucinations, even after the drug has been discontinued (Halpern & Pope, 2003). Further research is necessary to identify the mechanisms for this experience.Lysergic acid, a metabolite of LSD is similar in chemical structure to naturally occurring serotonin. Although the exact mechanism responsible for producing hallucinations is poorly understood, we do know that lysergic acid interacts with serotonin receptors.Caffeine is a stimulantstimulantAny drug that increases the activity of the nervous system.

 found in a range of sources, including coffee, tea, cola, energy drinks, and many over-the-counter pain relievers (see Figure 6.18). Caffeine interferes with the inhibition normally produced by adenosine in the brain. If you keep an inhibitory substance such as adenosine from doing its job, the result is increased excitation and alertness.Although most people think immediately of coffee when they hear the word caffeine, caffeine can be found in many beverages, foods, and over-the-counter medications.Caffeine produces a withdrawal syndrome characterized by headaches and fatigue. Some people experience problems with heart rhythms related to caffeine use. Caffeine crosses the placenta easily and also enters breast milk, leading to reduced rates of growth and other complications in the fetus and breastfed infant of a mother using the drug (Bakker et al., 2010). On the positive side, caffeine use is correlated with a lower risk of Parkinson’s disease, which causes difficulty moving (Ross & Petrovitch, 2001), as well as Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia (Eskelinen & Kivipelto, 2010). Because these are correlations, we don’t know whether the apparent protection against these conditions is because of some specific action of caffeine in the brain or is simply the result of the characteristics of people who enjoy large amounts of caffeine.As we mention in this chapter, many historical efforts to achieve altered states of consciousness emerged in religious contexts. These methods for producing altered states frequently move out of their original contexts, such as the use of drum circles in contemporary men’s gatherings.Use of drugs, and hallucinogens in particular, have a long history in religious rituals. When used in religious contexts, hallucinogens are often referred to as entheogens, loosely translated as generating the divine within. In South America, people were using a brew known as ayahuasca centuries ago as part of their religious rituals, but the practice has since spread globally. Ayahuasca contains the hallucinogen N, N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), which like most hallucinogens is chemically very similar to serotonin. DMT, which occurs naturally in small amounts in the brain, produces vivid visual hallucinations and euphoria but also intense vomiting. In contrast to the acceptance of ayahuasca in South America, DMT use is illegal in most countries. However, legal exceptions have been made for use of ayahuasca in religious settings. In 2006, the U.S. Supreme Court decided to allow ayahuasca churches to continue to use tea during their ceremonies.A popular interest in ayahuasca has led to the development of ayahuasca retreats in Peru, Colombia, and Brazil. This commercialization of the practice does bring money to poor regions but threatens the original context of the ritual. Pseudo-shamans are quite ready to make money from gullible tourists. The death of several ayahuasca tourists has raised concerns about the safety of the ayahuasca retreats.Many hallucinogens have their historical roots in religious practice. In South America, a hallucinogenic tea known as ayahuasca has been used for centuries. Interest on the part of tourists has led to the establishment of ayahuasca retreats, but opinions about the commercialization of historical religious practices are mixed.Outside the religious context, scientists continue to be interested in possible applications of the main ingredients of ayahuasca for treating depression and other psychological disorders (Domínguez-Clavé et al., 2016;  Sessa & Johnson, 2015).After caffeine, the most commonly used stimulant in the United States is nicotine, usually in the form of smoked or chewed tobacco (see Figure 6.19). Nicotine mimics the action of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, increasing heart rate and blood pressure, reducing fatigue, and improving cognitive performance while at the same time producing muscular relaxation. Normally, our bodies feel somewhat tense when we are mentally alert, so nicotine’s combination of relaxation with alertness is unique.Drug effects depend on the concentration of the drug in the blood supply, and some methods of administration produce effective concentrations faster than others. In the case of nicotine, smoking a cigarette (a) produces a faster increase in blood nicotine concentration than produced by chewing an equivalent dose of tobacco (b). However, chewing tobacco produces higher sustained concentrations of nicotine than smoking does.Despite repeated warnings of the dangers of using nicotine, it continues to be a widely used substance (see Chapter 16). Nicotine use typically begins in adolescence, and adolescents become more rapidly dependent on the substance than do adults (Dani & Harris, 2005). People with psychological disorders, schizophrenia and depression in particular, are very likely to use nicotine (Dani & Harris, 2005). Again, because these are correlations, we do not know whether nicotine has any causal role in the development of psychological disorders or whether people vulnerable to disorders are simply more likely to enjoy the effects of nicotine.The behavioral effects of cocaine and amphetamines are quite similar. At moderate doses, cocaine and amphetamines produce alertness, elevated mood, confidence, and a sense of well-being. At higher doses, these drugs can produce symptoms that are quite similar to schizophrenia (see Chapter 14). Users experience hallucinations, such as a feeling of bugs running on the skin, and delusional fears that others are trying to harm them. Some users experience repetitive motor behaviors, such as chewing movements or grinding the teeth. Methamphetamine, the current commonly abused form of amphetamines, is particularly likely to lead to symptoms of psychosis (McKetin, McLaren, Lubman, & Hides, 2006; see Figure 6.20).(a) Methamphetamine users are likely to experience psychotic symptoms, probably because of substantial loss of brain volume in areas related to memory, emotion, and reward. (b) Methamphetamine also stimulates clenching and grinding of teeth, leading to a pattern of dental decay known as meth mouth.Although they produce similar types of behavior, cocaine and amphetamines act somewhat differently at the synapse. Both drugs distort the action of dopamine transporters, gates that move previously released dopamine back into the presynaptic cell (see Chapter 4), but they do so differently. Methamphetamine mimics dopamine, leading it to be moved out of the synaptic gap into neurons by dopamine transporters. Once inside the neuron, methamphetamine enters synaptic vesicles, pushing the dopamine molecules out into the intracellular fluid of the axon terminal. The presence of large amounts of dopamine outside of vesicles makes the transporters begin to work in reverse, pushing dopamine out of the cell. With the transporters working in reverse and unable to retrieve the released dopamine, the molecules of dopamine become trapped in the synaptic gap, stimulating receptors continuously. Cocaine’s action on the dopamine transporters is simpler. Cocaine simply blocks the transporters, keeping all previously released dopamine active in the synaptic gap. Because of their direct actions on the dopamine reward systems in the brain, these drugs are among the most addictive available substances.As we will see in Chapter 15, many children diagnosed with ADHD are treated with stimulant medications. The two most common choices are methylphenidate or a combination of amphetamine salts (Adderall). Both of these drugs boost the activity of dopamine and norepinephrine, which in turn increases users’ ability to stay alert and concentrate. At clinical doses, these drugs do not seem to produce dependence, although they affect sleep and appetite. It is a common misconception that only people diagnosed with ADHD respond to these drugs with increased concentration. Everybody reacts to these drugs in similar ways (Agay, Yechiam, Carmel, & Levkovitz, 2010), which has led to an increase in their nonprescribed use by college students and others wishing to get a competitive edge in intellectual work.Before World War I, many commercial products contained cocaine. Freud originally believed that cocaine was an effective antidepressant. The ability of cocaine to produce rapid addiction eventually changed people’s minds about the safety of the drug.3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, or Ecstasy) is a relative of amphetamines and the hallucinogen mescaline that increases heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature. MDMA increases sociability by stimulating the activity of serotonin and oxytocin (Thompson, Callaghan, Hunt, Cornish, & McGregor, 2007). MDMA mimics serotonin and is actually taken up more readily than serotonin itself by serotonin transporters. Once inside the cell, MDMA interferes with the storage of serotonin in vesicles and causes the transporters to begin acting in reverse, resulting in the release of large amounts of serotonin. Serotonin becomes trapped in the synaptic gap by the malfunctioning transporters, allowing it to continue to interact with receptors. Side effects of MDMA can include dehydration, exhaustion, hyperthermia (high core body temperature), convulsions, and death (Pilgrim, Gerostamoulos, & Drummer, 2011). MDMA has a smaller effect on dopamine than on serotonin, but the drug can still produce some dependency.MDMA (Ecstasy) appears to have long-term detrimental effects on neurons that release serotonin, associated with mood, appetite, and sleep.Use of MDMA is controversial, with some scientists expressing concern about its apparent detrimental effects on neurons that release serotonin (Biezonski & Meyer, 2011;  Capela et al., 2007). Some therapists, however, argue that MDMA might be beneficial to individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Strong research evidence for such benefits is lacking (Parrott, 2007), but studies using participants with PTSD who had not responded to conventional treatments showed some promise (Mithoefer, Wagner, Mithoefer, Jerome, & Doblin, 2011;  Sessa, 2016).Alcohol is one of the earliest psychoactive drugs used by humans, dating back into our prehistory. In addition to seeking the relaxation produced by alcohol, early humans might have turned to fermented beverages as a safety precaution against contaminated water supplies because alcohol has natural antiseptic qualities.At low doses, alcohol dilates blood vessels, giving people a warm, flushed feeling. It reduces anxiety, which makes relatively shy people more outgoing at a party. At higher doses, alcohol’s inhibition of the higher levels of the brain leads to aggression, risky behaviors, and poor motor coordination. At very high doses, alcohol can produce coma and death, either from suppression of breathing or aspiration of vomit.Alcohol produces its main behavioral effects by boosting the effects of GABA, the main inhibitory neurochemical in the brain. By boosting an inhibitor, alcohol depresses the activity of the brain, particularly that of the cerebral cortex. At the same time, alcohol blocks receptors for the brain’s major excitatory neurotransmitter, glutamate. Finally, alcohol also stimulates reward pathways that release dopamine, which probably accounts for its addictive potential. Further discussion on the detrimental effects of alcohol on the developing fetus will be discussed in Chapter 11. Alcohol’s impact on health in general is discussed in Chapter 16.Natural or synthetic substances that interact with endorphin receptors are known as opioids. Opioids that are derived from the opium poppy are known as opiates. The opium poppy is the source of several psychoactive opiates, including morphine and codeine. Heroin can be synthesized through further processing of morphine. These substances are effective because they imitate the action of endorphins (short for endogenous morphine). Neurons possessing endorphin receptors are located in parts of the brain involved with pain, stress, and attachment. The activity of both natural endorphins and opioids results in the release of large amounts of dopamine, leading to feelings of well-being and reduction of pain.Opioids have legitimate medical purposes, including pain control, cough suppression, and control of diarrhea. At low doses typical in medical practice, opioids produce a sense of euphoria, pain relief, reduced anxiety, muscle relaxation, and sleep. The higher doses characteristic of opioid abuse affect consciousness by producing a strong, rapid onset feeling of euphoria, or a rush. With even higher doses, opioids exert a strong depression on breathing, occasionally leading to death.Among the current frequently abused forms of opioids is the relatively new painkiller oxycodone hydrochloride (OxyContin), reportedly used by more than 8% of recent 12th graders (Johnston, O’Malley, Bachman, & Schulenberg, 2011). In 2010, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a new formulation of OxyContin designed to reduce rates of abuse. Unfortunately, efforts to reduce OxyContin abuse usually result in compensatory increases in heroin use (Cicero, Ellis, & Surratt, 2012) (see Figure 6.21). Abuse of painkillers in general continues to be a serious concern in public health.Although the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a new formulation of OxyContin designed to be less prone to abuse, the overall levels of painkiller abuse were not affected much. Instead, a compensating increase in heroin use was observed beginning in 2010 as users apparently switched their drugs of choice.

 is a state of consciousness involving focused attention and reduced peripheral awareness characterized by an enhanced capacity for response to suggestion (Elkins, Barabasz, Council, & Spiegel, 2015, p. 6).Misunderstandings about what hypnosis can and cannot do are common. Early research suggested that hypnotized people were more likely to comply with requests to do dangerous things, such as pick up a poisonous snake or throw a beaker of what they believed to be acid into an experimenter’s face (Rowland, 1939;  Young, 1952). However, later experiments showed that equal compliance could be obtained with participants who were not hypnotized (Orne & Evans, 1965). In these situations, the participants’ strong belief that the experimenters would be unwilling to harm them overrode any measurable influence of hypnosis. Contrary to popular belief (and a number of television crime shows), hypnosis does not sharpen memory and is instead likely to make it worse (Register & Kihlstrom, 1987). Hypnosis does have legitimate uses in therapy, however, especially in cases of habit change (quitting smoking, etc.) and pain relief.Frustrated licensed psychotherapist Steve Eichel demonstrated the lack of regulation of hypnotherapists by acquiring a number of impressive-looking credentials for Zoe D. Katze, who happens to be Eichel’s cat. Zoe’s name is a wordplay on the German die Katze, which literally means the cat.One study that illustrates both the power and the limitations of hypnosis used a task known as the Stroop test (Raz, Kirsch, Pollard, & Nitkin-Kaner, 2006;  Stroop, 1935). In this test, participants are simply asked to respond to the color of the letters they are shown (see Figure 6.22). When the ink color and the word are congruent (e.g., the word red appears in red ink), reaction time is significantly faster (100–200 milliseconds faster) than when the ink color and the word are incongruent (e.g., the word red appears in green ink). Nearly everyone who can read shows a robust Stroop effect, and extensive training does not make the effect go away. This effect is typically explained in terms of a well-practiced skill (reading) taking precedence over a less practiced skill (naming the colors of letters). When instructed to ignore the practiced skill, attention is compromised, and reaction time becomes slower.Under normal circumstances, results of the Stroop test show that participants identify ink colors faster when (a) the color of the letters matches the word being read (the word red appears in a red font) than when (b) it doesn’t match (the word red appears in a yellow or green font). Highly suggestible hypnotized participants who were told that they were reading nonsense words instead of real words did not show this typical difference. Their reaction time for naming the ink color was the same whether it matched the color name or not.Using a posthypnotic suggestion,  Raz et al. (2006) told their participants to respond to a cue by viewing the stimuli as gibberish instead of real words. Participants were assessed for their individual differences in suggestibility, or the ease with which someone can be hypnotized. Participants who were rated as having low suggestibility performed in a typical manner on the Stroop test. In contrast, participants rated as having high suggestibility demonstrated little difference between the amount of time needed to identify the ink colors in the congruent and the incongruent conditions. The ability of posthypnotic suggestion to minimize the Stroop effect is remarkable because other efforts to modulate the effect have all failed. Clearly, hypnotic suggestion has the ability to reorganize cognitive processes, at least in highly suggestible individuals.MeditationMeditationA voluntary alteration of consciousness characterized by positive emotion and absence of thought

 techniques vary widely and may occur in either religious or nonreligious contexts. When experienced practitioners are asked to describe the subjective experience produced by meditation, they describe a conscious state without thought, accompanied by a blissful emotional state (Travis, 2001). A variation on meditation known as mindfulness meditation has been used more frequently over recent years to treat substance abuse and a variety of psychological disorders (Hölzel et al., 2011). Mindfulness refers to nonjudgmental awareness of experiences in the present moment (Hölzel et al., 2011, p. 537). Meditation incorporating mindfulness also appears to produce benefits in immune function, blood pressure, stress hormone levels, and cognitive functioning.EEG recordings during meditation feature increased proportions of alpha waves, which we described earlier as being characteristic of an awake but relaxed state. In participants who had meditated more than 3 years, increased theta activity, normally found in lighter stages of sleep, was observed over the frontal lobes of the brain (Aftanas & Golocheikine, 2001). Theta activity in the prefrontal areas of the brain has been correlated with positive emotions (Aftanas, Varlamov, Pavlov, Makhnev, & Reva, 2001).Imaging studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), suggest that meditation represents a voluntary regulation of attention and autonomic functions (Lazar et al., 2000). Brain imaging studies have discovered that experienced meditators showed less activity in the brain’s DMN, which was described earlier in this chapter (Brewer et al., 2011). As we noted previously, activity in the DMN is usually correlated not only with mind wandering and thinking about the self but also with unhappiness. Relative inhibition of the activity of the DMN through meditation might be responsible for the feelings of bliss associated with this practice (see Figure 6.23).Meditation is associated with a decrease in activation in the prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate gyrus, which are important parts of the DMN, of experienced meditators compared to control participants who were introduced to the meditation methods right before being scanned. The amount of decrease in signal strength is shown (a) in the prefrontal cortex and (b) in the posterior cingulate cortex. The colored bars represent three methods of mindfulness meditation: choiceless awareness is shown in green, loving kindness is shown in red, and concentration is shown in blue.Meditation appears to result in physical changes in the brain (Fox et al., 2014). Meditation has been correlated with increased cortical thickness (Lazar et al., 2005) and increased gray matter in the brainstem (Vestergaard-Poulsen et al., 2009). The increased cortical thickness was more noticeable in older participants, suggesting that meditation might offset typical age-related thinning of the cortex.A variety of environmental conditions have significant effects on consciousness, including exposure to high altitudes during mountain climbing, underwater conditions in scuba diving, starvation, sleep deprivation, sensory deprivation, twirling, and rhythm-induced trance. These conditions may lead to hallucination and other consistent changes in cognition and emotion.Several of these environmental factors characterize vision quests, which typically take place within religious contexts. In the traditional Native American vision quest, preparation typically involved 3 to 4 days of starvation and sleep loss. The individual would travel to an isolated location where no shelter could be built. The seeker would then be instructed to concentrate and watch for the appearance of a guardian. This combination of events reliably led seekers to experience the following phenomena: a distorted sense of time, a sensation of oneness, the appearance of light, the emotion of ecstasy or bliss, and a sense of improved insight (Steiger, 2000).We have all observed young children experiment with their bodies by spinning. Although we do not know the precise reason for such spinning behavior, other than that it is fun, spinning probably represents the child’s efforts to alter sensory and cognitive states. Spinning is also used as a meditation-inducing method by the Sufis, a mystic Muslim sect. Sufis may whirl for an hour or more before falling to the ground, where they seek a feeling of oneness with the Earth.Sufis belong to a mystic Muslim sect that uses spinning as a means of inducing a state of meditation. Spinning can last an hour or more, after which the Sufi typically falls to the ground and experiences a sense of oneness with the Earth.It is likely that dancing has been a part of human cultures for thousands of years, both for recreational and for religious purposes. Accompanied by the equally ancient practice of drumming, dance is capable of initiating trancelike states in the participants (Vaitl et al., 2005). A trance state typically refers to an induced state of consciousness in which a person is less responsive to external stimuli (Tassi & Muzet, 2001). The altered states induced by drumming and dancing include distortion of time, vivid imagery, and strong positive emotions such as ecstasy and bliss (Vaitl et al., 2013). Participants listening to rhythmic drumming showed more theta wave activity in their EEGs, normally associated with light N-REM sleep, than did participants listening to unstructured beat sequences (Winkelman, 2003).Modern youth are fond of combining dance and psychoactive drugs to alter consciousness, particularly in the context of raves, which are large parties featuring electronic music, darkness, and the use of hallucinogens or MDMA. The raves feature some themes common to the contexts we have described previously. Unity, or oneness, and positive emotion are again primary goals reported by the participants.We engage in a variety of unconscious behaviors, and not just when we’re asleep. Among the unconscious behaviors that have been identified by psychologists is one that is particularly relevant to relationships—the effect of mimicry on liking and feeling close to others (Lakin, Chartrand, & Arkin, 2008). A substantial body of research supports the idea that we unconsciously copy the behavior of others and that when we do copy another person’s behavior, that person likes us better without necessarily knowing why.Under what circumstances are we most likely to copy the behavior of other people? One possible answer is that we mimic others to avoid or repair social exclusion. Jessica Lakin and her colleagues (2008) made their participants feel socially excluded (temporarily) and then observed that these excluded participants were more likely to mimic another person than were participants who had not been socially excluded. This process extends to group membership as well. Participants excluded by an in-group were subsequently more likely to mimic an in-group member than an out-group member. These results suggest that mimicry developed as an automatic behavior that we could use to respond to threats to our social connectivity, which as we have stated many times previously, could have been a matter of life or death to our hunter–gatherer ancestors.We often imitate the behavior of others without being consciously aware that we’re doing so. Imitation seems to enhance liking and social inclusion.Because this mimicry is quite automatic and unconscious, we are usually not aware that we are behaving this way. Knowing now that this is an adaptive behavior, look more closely at how you behave when encountering situations in which you feel excluded. It could be a social situation, such as at a party or an organizational event, where you are trying to mingle or initiate a dialogue with others. Or perhaps you observe mimicry when you are around someone you like romantically. Do you feign interest in things you wouldn’t necessarily be interested in otherwise? Are you more apt to align yourself with the personality of the person you find interesting? Do you see this kind of behavior in friends or family?Attorneys often remind us that what is right is not always legal, and what is legal is not always right. One of the tragic outcomes of cyberbullying is suicide by the victim, leading to the coining of the term bullycide. In spite of the obvious role the bully is playing in these cases, the U.S. legal system is not always able to prove that the victim’s suicide was caused by the bully rather than an act of free will.Several recent cases illustrate the legal challenges in cyberbullying cases. In 2010, Tyler Clementi jumped to his death in the Hudson River after realizing his roommate and a friend had livestreamed images of Clementi having sex with another man. Although the roommate was found guilty of all the charges brought by the prosecution, his sentence was 30 days in jail. In 2007, 47-year-old Lori Drew played a terrible trick on one of her daughter’s friends, Megan Meier, after the two girls had a falling out. Drew impersonated a boy online and convinced Megan the boy liked her. Subsequently, Drew posted a note to Megan saying that the world would be a better place without you. Megan hung herself, but in the absence of any relevant statutes, Drew went completely unpunished.Rutgers first-year student Tyler Clementi, a gifted violinist, committed suicide when he discovered that his roommate had secretly filmed him having sex with another man and had broadcast the film on the Internet. Because the U.S. legal system views suicide largely as an act of free will, the roommate was sentenced to only 30 days in jail.Finding a person guilty of homicide in the United States requires a strict legal standard of causality that quickly becomes complicated in cases where someone has driven another to suicide. The current legal system, based on long traditions of free will, does not hold bullies responsible for a victim’s suicide unless they inflict severe physical injury or make the victim mentally irresponsible (Rogers, 2014). Changes in legal interpretations that consider the special nature of cyberbullying might result in more intuitively fair outcomes. If the legal system takes into account the imbalance of power that commonly exists between a cyberbully and victim, the nature and severity of the bullying, and the ability of the victim to avoid the bullying, it might become more likely for perpetrators like Lori Drew to be held accountable for their actions.Drug classActs onLSDSerotoninMarijuanaEndogenous cannabinoidsCaffeineAdenosineNicotineAcetylcholineCocaine, amphetamines, and methamphetamineDopamineMethylphenidateDopamineMDMA (Ecstasy)Serotonin, oxytocinAlcoholGABA, dopamineOpioidsEndogenous endorphins
