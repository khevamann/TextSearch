Around the age of 3 years, fiber pathways connecting the frontal lobes with the rest of the brain are developing rapidly, making changes in decision making and memory possible.What is your earliest memory? A birthday party? A new puppy? We are guessing that your earliest autobiographical memories, which we discussed in Chapter 9, probably date to when you were between 3 and 5 years old. Why this age period and not another?Zooming in, we can see that one of the factors driving memory abilities is the development of the brain during childhood. As you will see in this chapter, changes taking place in the hippocampus and frontal lobes during the third year of life give children a boost in their abilities to form long-term memories, particularly about the sequences of events that make up our autobiographical memories. But there are other parts to this story.To form an autobiographical memory, children must have a sense of self. As we discussed in Chapter 6, babies as young as 18 months can recognize themselves in a mirror. In this chapter, you will learn about the further development of self-awareness as children gradually separate from their parents and family and move into adult roles in the community.Zooming out still farther, we find that cultures influence the formation and timing of autobiographical memories. When white American adults are compared with Chinese adults, the white Americans access more autobiographical memories from earlier ages and provide more episodic details of these memories (Wang, 2008). Wang believes that this difference observed in adults originates earlier in childhood, when white American children show more emotion knowledge, or an understanding of how situations can lead to emotions, than do Chinese children (see Figure 11.1). Emotion knowledge is assessed by asking children such questions as, What makes people happy? Cultures influence emotion knowledge development by focusing on information relevant to the self versus more general aspects of information.White American adults recall more childhood autobiographical memories in greater detail than do Chinese adults. These differences may have their roots in earlier cultural influences on emotional knowledge or an understanding of how a situation can lead to emotions. When asked to describe situations that would make a person happy, sad, fearful, or angry, white American children provided more information than Chinese or Chinese immigrant children. Emotional knowledge increases when a person focuses on information relevant to the self rather than more general information.To understand the development of autobiographical memory, psychologists must explore the biological, individual, developmental, social, and cultural contributions to this ability. At the same time, the development of an autobiographical memory capability forms reciprocal influences with these other aspects of the individual’s behavior. In this chapter, we will explore many examples of how the normal changes that occur across the life span interact with our behavior and mental processing.A major milestone in children’s development of a sense of self is the ability to recognize themselves in a mirror by the age of 18 months.

In Chapter 8, we defined learning as a relatively permanent change in behavior due to experience. In this chapter, we will explore an additional force for changes in behavior—changes that unfold with the passage of time. The study of human development considers changes in behavior that correlate with growth or maturation.As we explore the normal changes that occur at different stages of life, we will concentrate on three interwoven threads: physical development, cognitive development, and social/emotional development. Although we discuss each separately, they are constantly interacting. For example, moving independently by crawling or walking produces a more rapidly changing and interesting environment, which spurs an infant’s cognitive growth. At the same time, a mobile infant is likely to elicit different reactions from parents or caretakers than one who is stationary, stimulating further social and emotional development.In addition to documenting these three types of change over time, the study of development highlights several major questions that stretch across the entire life span. How does nature interact with nurture? Is development gradual and continuous or abrupt and discontinuous? How much of human development is universal across the human species or dependent upon a person’s culture?

Although we will be discussing the genetic heritage of individuals, as well as environmental influences on their development, we will be emphasizing the interactions between nature and nurture that predict developmental outcomes. Significant progress has been made in the understanding of how genes and the environment interact. As we discussed in Chapter 3, we now understand that the underlying deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that makes up our genes is turned on or off by the surrounding chemical tags (the epigenome) that accumulate through life. Among the external environmental factors that can chemically tag our DNA are diet, nurture, and stress.Early developmental psychologists described normal age-related changes up through childhood to puberty but not beyond. Today, we know that the ages represented in these four generations bring their own set of characteristic behaviors.Epigenetic influences accumulate over the life span. Because younger children have had less time for epigenetic interactions between their genes and their experience to take place, they have more in common with one another at any particular age than do older adults, whose decades of experience have caused their epigenetic paths to lead them in many directions. A group of 8-year-olds is more consistent in its physical characteristics and behaviors than a group of 20-year-olds, who still have more in common with one another than any group of 65-year-olds. This contrast between children and adults might have led earlier psychologists to the mistaken belief that development stopped at some point in childhood or adolescence, when all they were seeing was a transition point where internal influences were becoming overshadowed by external ones.

Another major question asks whether development proceeds gradually and smoothly over time (continuity) or changes more abruptly from one stage to the next (discontinuity). The gradual approach might be visualized as a rainbow, with one color (stage) gradually merging into the next, with no bold line separating the two. In contrast, the discontinuity approach views development as a staircase to be climbed. The behavior on one step is qualitatively different from that on the step that preceded it, and the change from one step to the other is abrupt (see Figure 11.2).Development can appear as a gradual, continuous process, such as the acorn growing into a mighty oak tree, or as a sudden, discontinuous process, such as the butterfly emerging from a chrysalis.As children develop physically, they are able to move out into the world. Mobile children face new problems that stretch their cognitive abilities and new social and emotional challenges as they learn self-regulation and experience control from their parents.As in the case of nature and nurture, the continuity–discontinuity debate does not have a right answer. Some features appear to be more continuous in their developmental course, such as the gradual development of infant temperament into later personality. Other features seem to develop more abruptly. Parents are often surprised when their child becomes suddenly more mobile, such as rolling across the bed or walking, although the underlying physical development is probably quite gradual.

Psychologists taking the universal approach to development look for age-related behaviors that are found across the entire human species, whereas psychologists taking an ecological view ask questions about the impact of culture and environment on development.Which approach is correct? Both universal and ecological approaches improve our understanding. Although we will see universals of development in this chapter, such as the age at which most children begin walking unassisted, we will also see that children growing up in cultures where early walking is encouraged walk at slightly younger ages than children growing up in cultures where restricting infant movement is the norm. Although a consideration of human universals is useful, most contemporary psychologists would be unwilling to consider many behaviors outside their context of social relationships and culture.Epigenetic influences accumulate over the life span. Groups of 8-year-olds have more in common than groups of 20-year-olds, who have more in common than groups of older adults. The contrast between the degree of similarity seen in children and that seen in adults might have led early developmental psychologists to the mistaken conclusion that development stops.

The 9 months between conception and birth are full of growth and activity. For the first 2 gestational weeks, the developing organism is known as a zygotezygoteThe term used to describe a developing organism immediately following conception

.The universal approach sees development as common to all people, whereas the ecological approach emphasizes the influences of environment and culture on development. In the United States, we tend to look at child soldiers, some as young as 10 years old, as being a product of the poverty and lack of opportunity in their environments. However, some universal aspects of being a preteen or young teen, such as an immature sense of morality and greater obedience to adults, might apply equally to very young violent gang members in the United States.During the first gestational week, the zygote differentiates into three germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm (see Figure 11.3). The ectoderm develops into nerve tissue and skin, while the mesoderm gives rise to muscle and bone. The endoderm is the source of the body’s soft tissue, such as the organs of the digestive tract. By gestational week four, the central nervous system has differentiated into forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain, and spinal cord. By gestational week seven, cells that will form the cerebral cortex begin a carefully orchestrated journey from the lining of the neural tube (which will ultimately develop into the ventricles of the brain) to their ultimate destinations.(a) For the first 2 gestational weeks, the developing organism is known as a zygote. (b) Cell division continues at a rapid pace as the zygote travels down the mother’s fallopian tube, reaching the uterus during its second week. (c) The embryo stage lasts from gestational week 3 through gestational week 8. (d) During the zygote stage, cells begin to differentiate into three types: The ectoderm, which is the source of cells making up the nervous system; the mesoderm, which develops into muscle and skeleton; and the endoderm, which will form internal organs.Other systems, while perhaps not as dramatic as the nervous system, also begin to differentiate and develop during the embryonic stage. The heart, stomach, liver, and other organs are formed during this period. During the sixth gestational week, expression of a gene on the Y chromosome initiates the differentiation of the generic gonads into testes in males, while alternate genes guide the development of the gonads into ovaries in females.The remainder of the pregnancy involves continued growth and maturation of the systems that are now in place (see Figure 11.4). During gestational month three, generic internal reproductive organs differentiate into the uterus, fallopian tubes, and upper portion of the vagina in females and into the seminal vesicles, vas deferens, and prostate in males. New neurons are born in large numbers and begin the process of forming connections with one another. Myelination of the nervous system begins at gestational month six (Rivkin et al., 1995). As you may recall from Chapter 4, myelin allows neurons to communicate faster and more efficiently. By gestational month seven, most of the brain’s cells have been formed (Rakic, 2000).During the fetal stage, from gestational week 8 to approximately gestational week 40, considerable growth and maturation of organs and tissues prepare the fetus for birth.You may be under the impression that the fetus resides in a rather isolated, self-contained environment in the womb, but this is not the case. The fetus’s ability to hear noises outside the mother’s body is quite good during the last few months of pregnancy (Birnholz & Benacerraf, 1983). Newborn babies show an immediate preference for their mother’s voice (DeCasper & Fifer, 1980). When pregnant mothers read the Dr. Seuss classic The Cat in the Hat out loud twice a day, their infants later preferred to listen to tapes of their mothers, but not others, reading this story (DeCasper & Spence, 1986). This preference has obvious advantages in the attachment and bonding that occurs between mother and newborn.Most pregnancies last about 40 weeks, and babies born between gestational weeks 37 and 42 are considered typical or term births. In the United States, just over 12% of babies are born prematurely or before 37 weeks of pregnancy (Witt et al., 2014), and 2% are born before 32 weeks of pregnancy (Cole et al., 2011). Premature infants are at greater risk than term infants for a number of conditions that can affect lifetime health and development, including disorders of the lungs, vision, and development of the brain (Cole et al., 2011).Compared to a typical baby born around gestational week 40, who is usually about 20 inches long and weighs about 7 pounds, little Baby Emilia was only about 8 inches long and weighed about 1/2 pound, about the size of a bell pepper. Nine months after birth, Emilia had grown to the size of the typical newborn.

In most cases, prenatal development proceeds according to plan. As we observed in Chapter 3, genetic abnormalities that have adverse effects are rarely passed along in large numbers.The more common genetic abnormalities seen in children are those that become more likely when their parents are older. Errors in the development of eggs and sperm are more likely in older parents. The final division of a woman’s immature egg, formed during her own prenatal period, into a mature ovum does not occur until just before ovulation. Before they make this last crucial division, a 40-year-old woman’s eggs have been exposed to 40 years of potentially harmful environmental influences that raise the probability that something will go wrong as they divide. In contrast, it takes a little over 2 months for a man to produce a sperm cell, which reduces the chances of the cell’s exposure to harmful influences.Down syndrome, or trisomy 21, results when the child receives a third full or partial copy of the 21st chromosome along with the usual two, usually because of faulty cell division (see Figure 11.5). Down syndrome results in intellectual disability (see Chapter 10), a pattern of mild physical abnormalities, and a probable life span of only 40 to 50 years. A woman’s chances of giving birth to a child with Down syndrome are only about 1 in 2,000 at age 20 but rise to 1 in 30 at age 45.Many genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome, are more common as the age of the mother increases. Errors in the final cell division forming the mother’s egg immediately before ovulation become more likely over time as a woman is exposed to more potentially harmful environmental influences, such as radiation.

According to one expert in medical ethics, today’s technology makes it possible to screen embryos for every known disease-causing mutation in the human genome (Leroi, 2006). What would be the benefits and costs of this practice?During pregnancy, the developing fetus is protected from exposure to toxins and disease-causing agents by the placenta, an organ attached to the wall of the mother’s uterus that provides the fetus with nutrients and oxygen. This protection, however, is not perfect. In some cases, substances that are relatively safe for the mother can have devastating effects on the health and development of her fetus. Any agent that can produce harmful effects in the zygote, embryo, or fetus is known as a teratogenteratogenA chemical agent that can harm the zygote, embryo, or fetus

 (see Figure 11.6). Table 11.1 lists some common teratogens and their effects. Exposure to commonly used antidepressant medications has been linked to higher rates of premature birth (Kendall-Tackett & Hale, 2010) and autism spectrum disorder (Harrington, Lee, Crum, Zimmerman, & Hertz-Picciotto, 2014;  Rai, Lee, Dalman, Newschaffer, Lewis, & Magnusson, 2017). Use of acetaminophen (Tylenol and Anacin) during pregnancy is associated with higher risk for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children (Liew, Ritz, Rebordosa, Lee, & Olsen, 2014). Use of antifungal medications by a pregnant woman reduces masculinization of her male offspring (Mogensen et al., 2017). Because even the safest and most routine substances are capable of acting as teratogens, pregnant women are well advised to consult with health care providers before taking any type of prescription or over-the-counter medication.The orange bars indicate the overall time during which a system is developing. The yellow bars indicate when particular systems are most vulnerable to disrupted development because of teratogens.TeratogenTypePossible effects on the childAlcoholRecreational drugSmall statureFacial abnormalitiesHyperactivityIntellectual disabilityPhenytoin (Dilantin)Prescription medication for epilepsyHeart defectsIntellectual disabilityCleft palateSlow growthSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (Prozac, Zoloft, etc.)Prescription antidepressantsPremature birthAutism spectrum disorderVaricella (chickenpox)Viral infectionScarsSmall head sizeBlindnessSeizuresMalformed and paralyzed limbsZikaViral infectionMicroencephalyAspirinOver-the-counter pain medicationHeart defectsIntellectual disabilitySlow growthAcetaminophenOver-the-counter pain medicationHigher risk for ADHDRecreational drugs consumed by the mother are the most common and preventable sources of adverse effects in the developing fetus. Infants born to women who use tobacco are at risk for premature birth and being underweight, circumstances that are major risk factors for numerous physical and psychological problems later on in the child’s life (CDC, 2010).The intricate programming of nervous system development in the fetus appears to be especially vulnerable to interruption by alcohol consumed by the mother during pregnancy (Haycock, 2009). Alcohol consumption by a pregnant woman can result in a condition known as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS)fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS)A condition resulting from alcohol consumption by the mother during pregnancy that produces physical abnormalities
    
        fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS)

. As shown in Figure 11.7, FAS produces a number of physical abnormalities, including growth retardation, skin folds at the corners of the eyes, nose, and mouth abnormalities, and a small head circumference, as well as cognitive and behavioral problems, including reduced IQ, attention problems, and poor impulse control (Streissguth, 1991).No known amount of alcohol consumption is considered safe during pregnancy, yet about 8% of pregnant women in the United States drinks some alcohol, and about 1.4% binge drink or have five or more drinks at one time (CDC, 2012). Drinking during pregnancy can result in FAS, which produces (a) characteristic facial features, (b) reduced brain volume compared to (c) a typically developing fetus, and attentional and other behavioral problems in children.A mother’s use of alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, or cocaine during pregnancy significantly reduces the volume of gray matter of her child’s brain, but combinations of two or more of these drugs produce even more dramatic reductions. As we mentioned in Chapter 4, gray matter refers to areas populated by neural cell bodies, and the thickness of cortical gray matter is correlated with measures of intelligence. These are not short-term effects because children exposed prenatally to multiple drugs show reduced gray matter thickness and head circumference at 10 to 13 years of age (Rivkin et al., 2008).A pregnant woman can be exposed to viruses that can trigger conditions that occur immediately or later in the child’s life (Cannon, 2003). HIV can be passed from mother to child during pregnancy, birth, or breast-feeding. Prenatal exposure to the mosquito-borne Zika virus, first identified in Brazil in 2015, produces abnormally small brains (microcephaly) and other serious brain abnormalities in the fetus (Rasmussen, Jamieson, Honein, & Petersen, 2016).Newborn babies grasp anything placed in their hand, including a parent’s finger.

Human development is characterized by a longer period of dependency than in other primates, including chimpanzees and gorillas. Physical abilities present at birth in other primates, such as independent movement, require about 1 year to develop in human infants (Walker & Shipman, 1996). Human adults house, feed, clothe, protect, and educate their young for the better part of two decades, if not longer. However, even though human newborns are less mature than primate infants of other species, they come into the world with a number of useful capacities.

The newborn stage of life begins officially at birth and lasts 28 days. Newborns have a number of reflexive behaviors that begin to operate immediately (see Table 11.2). Babies immediately turn their head to the source of a touch, open their mouth, and search for the mother’s nipple. This rooting reflex assists the newborn with the essential process of feeding. If an object is placed in the mouth, babies begin to suck reflexively, which also leads to effective feeding. Very young babies reflexively grasp any object placed in the hand, which leads to the later voluntary grasping of objects. If parents hold newborns upright with their feet touching a surface, babies show a stepping reflex, which possibly serves as a basis for later walking (Zelazo, 1998).Reflex nameActionPossible purposeBabinskiStroking the baby’s foot causes toes to spread out.Unknown; disappears as nervous system matures.BlinkEye closes in response to strong stimuli.Protects eyes.MoroIf the baby’s head falls backward, the arms first spread out and then hug.A possible evolutionary remnant allowing primates to cling to an adult.PalmarPlacing an object in the hand produces reflexive grasping.A possible evolutionary remnant allowing primates to cling to an adult’s fur.RootingStroking a baby’s cheek results in the baby turning toward the touch and opening the mouth.Helps the baby nurse.SteppingPlacing the baby’s feet on a flat surface initiates stepping.Possible precursor to walking.SuckingThe baby sucks anything that touches the roof of the mouth.Helps the baby nurse.

Newborns spend up to 16 to 18 hours per day sleeping. As we mentioned in Chapter 6, a large proportion of this time is spent in REM sleep, which might participate in the wiring of the newborn’s brain.A child’s sex chromosomes, XX or XY, typically begin a trajectory towards adult maleness and femaleness but not always. Intersex refers to the presence of male and female features in the same individual. Model Hanne Gaby Odiele recently disclosed that she has androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS). People with AIS are genetic males (XY) who do not respond to circulating male hormones in utero. They are born with female-appearing external genitalia and typically maintain female gender identities. Because the female reproductive organs are suppressed during fetal development, these individuals are likely to be infertile.During times of wakefulness, the baby alternates between periods of alert looking about and periods of physical movement of the arms and legs. Unfortunately for parents, most newborns also spend about 2 to 3 hours per day either crying or being close to tears. As upsetting as this crying may be, it represents the infant’s first efforts at communicating with the parents. Babies generally cry for a reason, such as hunger or pain, and most parents are stimulated by the crying to find ways to make their infant more comfortable.

We refer to physiological characteristics, such as having an XX or XY genotype as sex, while psychosocial aspects of the maleness—femaleness continuum are referred to as gender. The receipt of either an XX or XY genotype at conception (there are variations, though) begins a cascade of hormonal, structural, and behavioral events that lead to mature sex and gender.The appearance of the newborn’s external genitalia remains an important marker of sex and gender. The appearance of the external genitalia is usually, but not always, consistent with genetic sex. In cases of androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS), an individual with male genetic sex (XY) cannot respond to circulating male hormones, leading to female external appearance. A very rare condition known as 5-alpha-reductase syndrome results in ambiguous genitalia at birth with later masculinization at puberty. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) exposes the fetus to excess male hormones, which has little effect on male sexual development but might masculinize the external genitalia of genetic females (Meyer-Bahlburg et al., 2016).

Newborns have significant, although immature, sensory capacities. Because babies can’t talk, researchers have had to be creative in assessing their sensory capacities (see Figure 11.8). Measures of heart rate, facial expression, and head movements correlate with distinctions among stimuli. Researchers also take advantage of habituation, the type of learning in which we reduce responding to repeated stimuli (see Chapter 8). Because of habituation, babies gaze longer at a new stimulus than at one they have seen previously. When babies spend equal time looking at two stimuli, we can assume they cannot tell the difference between them.By studying the amount of time infants look at a new stimulus after habituation, such as the face of a person, Ross Flom and Lorraine Bahrick were able to demonstrate that infants as young as 4 months could correctly perceive emotional expression if they both saw and heard the same expression simultaneously. The ability to perceive emotion using voice alone appeared around the age of 5 months, and the ability to perceive emotion from facial expression alone appeared around 7 months.Newborns show considerable sensitivity to smells and respond differently to pleasant smells such as chocolate or honey than to unpleasant smells such as rotten eggs (Maurer & Maurer, 1988). They are also capable of recognizing their mother by smell, which has obvious survival advantages. Babies even recognize their mother’s favorite brand of perfume (Porter, 1991). Infants are quite sensitive to taste and can respond differentially to the major taste qualities of sweet, sour, bitter, and salty. They apparently have a sweet tooth and nurse longer when their breast-feeding mother has consumed sweet-tasting foods (Mennella & Beauchamp, 1996).The fetus can hear quite well beginning in gestational month seven, but improvement in hearing continues after birth. We might tiptoe around a sleeping newborn, but older children and adults have superior hearing for very quiet sounds. The infant’s ability to hear is best for sounds found in the range of frequencies that normally occur in human speech. This ability allows infants to learn language.Infant vision can be tested by measuring the amount of time the child spends viewing a pattern rather than a uniform screen. Using this technique, we can demonstrate that young infants do not see detail at a distance as well as adults do. In addition, infants need more contrast than adults to see well. As we discussed in Chapter 5, contrast refers to differences in intensity between adjacent stimuli. The black letters on this white page are an example of high contrast, whereas dark gray letters on a black background would be an example of low contrast. These features of infant vision probably explain babies’ preference for large, high- contrast, colorful objects.Newborns demonstrate an innate preference for looking at faces (Otsuka, 2014) (see Figure 11.9). This capacity sets the stage for further social behavior and language learning. We know that infants who refuse to make eye contact often develop social and language impairments later (Knickmeyer, Baron-Cohen, Raggatt, & Taylor, 2005;  Mundy et al., 2007). Other primates show similar preferences for faces, which may be related to the importance of social relationships in primate species, including our own (Thierry, 1994).Newborns looked at the stimulus on the left for about 16 seconds longer than the less facelike stimulus on the right. Looking time has been used as one measure of preference for infants.The emerging picture of the newborn infant is one of immature yet formidable capacities. The remainder of this chapter will explore the unfolding of these capabilities as the individual matures.StageTimingHighlightsZygoteGestational weeks 1–2Differentiation into germ layersEmbryoGestational weeks 3–8Nervous system and organs formSex organs differentiate into male and femaleFetusGestational week 9 through remainder of pregnancyGrowth and maturation of existing organsREM sleep from seventh month of pregnancyGood hearing from seventh month of pregnancyNewbornFirst 28 days of lifeReflexive movementLarge amounts of sleepImproving sensory capacitiesPreference for faces

Physical development in infancy and childhood features rapid growth, particularly during the first year of life, when children triple their birth weight (see Figure 11.10).Infants grow rapidly, tripling their birth weight during the first year alone. As they grow, their proportions also change significantly. The head takes up approximately one-quarter of a newborn’s height, versus about one-seventh to one-eighth of an adult’s height. In contrast, the ratio of the trunk to the overall height, about three-eighths, remains the same over the life span.

In the latter months of pregnancy and for the first 18 months of life, the human brain shows rapid growth in gray matter or collections of neural cell bodies, which we discussed in Chapter 4. Following this burst of brain growth, cells and connections that are not useful are systematically deleted. In other words, we produce more neurons and synapses than we will eventually need and then keep only those that are working well for us (see Figure 11.11).During development, we produce more synapses than necessary. Synapses that are not useful are deleted in a process known as synaptic pruning. Pruning takes place at different rates in different systems, as illustrated by this comparison of pruning in the visual and prefrontal cortices. This process emphasizes the importance of experiencing enriched environments during development.If a child’s rate of growth during the first year of life continued, a 10-year-old would be about the size of a jumbo jet (McCall, 1979).What does it mean to have neurons and synapses that are working well? The nervous system develops according to a use it or lose it principle, which emphasizes the important role of experience in wiring the brain. Children who are raised in a stimulating and enriched environment, with many things to explore, are likely to have the best outcomes. Children living in intellectually impoverished circumstances may retain too few connections, which may lead to mild forms of intellectual disability (see Chapter 10).Myelination, the growth in white matter that begins around gestational month six, continues to develop at a regular rate throughout childhood and adolescence (see Figure 11.12) (Houston, Herting, & Sowell, 2013). An interesting spurt in myelination occurs between the ages of 6 and 13 years in parts of the brain associated with language and spatial relations (Thompson, 2000). The rather sudden end of this white matter growth coincides with the end of a sensitive period for language development. Bilingual individuals who learn language after the age of 10 or so process their second languages differently than do native-language speakers (van Hell & Tokowicz, 2010). Unfortunately, most students in the United States begin foreign language study after this age.Imaging technologies have captured the progress of myelination (white matter growth) in childhood. Red and yellow areas show the largest changes. Myelinated systems are faster and more efficient than unmyelinated systems.

As we mentioned earlier, newborn human infants are relatively helpless compared to their chimpanzee and gorilla counterparts. Newborn humans’ mobility is handicapped by their proportions. One quarter of their length is made up by newborns’ heads. In contrast, adults’ heads make up approximately one-seventh to one-eighth of their height. Motor development, or change in our ability to move and perform physical skills, is largely driven by our human genetic blueprint. Identical twins typically reach motor milestones such as walking with more similar timing than that of fraternal twins or nontwin siblings (Fox, Hershberger, & Bouchard, 1996). Because identical twins share more genes in common compared with fraternal twins, reaching milestones at the same time indicates an important role for genetics in early motor development.Motor development in childhood proceeds simultaneously in two directions. First, we see development in the head-to-toe direction. Controlling the muscles of the neck and shoulders allows 2-month-old infants to raise their head to look around. This achievement is followed by development of the muscles of the torso around 3 months of age, which are necessary for rolling and sitting. Between 6 and 9 months, babies begin to crawl, although some happily skip this stage. Finally, around the first birthday, the muscles of the legs are developed sufficiently to support the weight of a child when standing or walking. Well into middle childhood, children continue to improve their movement and coordination, demonstrated by the abilities to skip rope, hop on one foot, and combine movements, such as throwing a ball while running (see Figure 11.13).These motor milestones emerge at predictable times over the course of childhood but can range significantly from child to child. The ages in this chart represent the average time at which children reach a milestone.Parents in most cultures attempt to teach toileting practices when children are about 2 years old. Not coincidentally, the motor systems required to achieve sphincter control are generally myelinated somewhere around 21 months of age (Largo, Molinari, von Siebenthal, & Wolfensberger, 1996).The second direction of motor development begins at the midline, an imaginary line dividing the human body in equal halves, and proceeds outward. Infants can bat at toys suspended above their cribs (3 months) before they are able to grasp objects (5 months). In other words, accurately directing the arms precedes the ability to direct the hands and fingers. Incidentally, infants learn to grasp objects before they learn to release them, a fact parents may wish to consider before wearing long hair or dangling earrings. Well into elementary school, children are continuing to master control over the fine muscle movements of the hands and fingers required for writing. Perhaps you recall the rather large-lined paper you used in first grade and the challenges of coloring within the lines.Kenyan parents often encourage early walking in their children. Compared to American children, whose average age of walking unassisted is about 1 year, Kenyan children observed by  Super (1976) walked between the ages of 7 and 11 months. In contrast, practices such as swaddling young infants are associated with slightly later attainment of motor milestones.Although early motor milestones are driven largely by biology, they respond to experience. It is possible to slow down motor milestones by restricting movement. Some cultures, out of safety concerns, restrict the movement opportunities of young children, which slightly delays motor milestones such as walking alone (Kaplan, 1987). In other cases, motor milestones may be reached slightly earlier by providing specific practice in sitting, standing, and walking (Super, 1976). These changes in the developmental timeline are usually slight, because myelination of motor nerves usually just precedes the achievement of a new skill. Once the relevant parts of the nervous system are sufficiently mature, new skills develop rapidly with little practice.

Like most other types of human behavior, gender identity, or the sense of one’s own place on a scale from maleness to femaleness, develops in response to both biological and environmental factors.Children begin to prefer sex-typed toys between the ages of 12 and 18 months, although at this age, they are not yet able to match sex-typed toys (vehicles or dolls) with male or female faces and voices. This suggests that they have not yet been socialized to think of particular toys as male or female (Serbin, Poulin-Dubois, Colburne, Sen, & Eichstedt, 2001). The fact that young vervet monkeys make similar sex-typed toy choices as young humans suggests that socialization has relatively little to do with these early differences in behavior (Alexander & Hines, 2002). Cases of girls with CAH, who experience unusually high levels of prenatal exposure to male hormones also provide insight into toy choice. In spite of the fact that many parents of CAH girls are determined to socialize them in a feminine direction to make them normal, the girls show much greater interest than typically developing girls do in masculine toys (see Figure 11.14) (Hines, 2010). This is not to say that parental and societal socialization has no impact on gender identity, but rather to remind us that biology and experience interact to produce an outcome.Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) results in higher prenatal exposure to male hormones in both females and males. Girls with CAH show less interest in girls’ toys and more interest in boys’ toys than is shown by healthy females. Boys with CAH show the same interest in both types of toys as do healthy boys.Very young vervet monkeys show the same toy preferences as young human children, suggesting that biology plays a role in the choice of sex-typical toys.By the age of 3 years, children begin using gender labels consistently for themselves, although we don’t know for certain whether this represents an awareness of their assigned gender or an identification with their assigned gender (Meyer-Bahlburg et al., 2016). A small number of children with unambiguous biological sex develop incongruent gender identity. Complex interactions among genetic, hormonal, cognitive, and psychosocial factors contribute to the development of a transgender identity. Follow-up studies suggest that earlier social transition to the experienced gender is the most reliable predictor of persistence with that gender in adulthood (Meyer-Bahlburg, 2013).The concept of gender has been transformed from a binary, categorical system (male or female) to more of a bimodal continuum (see Chapter 2). This transition is evident in the legal codes of many nations, where official government documents such as passports now provide options other than male or female, and in the social media giant Facebook’s 58 choices for personal identifiers, plus unique identifiers that users choose for themselves.Health care providers find no easy solutions within this environment when faced with cases of individuals with ambiguous physical features resulting from chromosome and hormonal influences. Gender assignment using the more traditional binary choices, in spite of passports and Facebook, remains a common goal within the medical community.One of the most contentious areas of gender assignment involves individuals born with ovotesticular syndrome (Meyer-Bahlburg et al., 2016). These individuals used to be referred to as true hermaphrodites, as they possess a gonad that contains both testicular tubular structures and ovarian follicles. Typically, about half of the newborns in this category are assigned to the female gender and the other half to the male gender, but clinicians do not necessarily agree on the criteria for making this judgment. Some are more influenced by the surgical challenges presented by an individual case while others consider fertility. As a result, many individuals with ovotesticular syndrome later develop gender dysphoria, a sense of mismatch between their assigned gender and their identities, and/or patient-initiated gender change.Perhaps the fluidity of the concept of gender will make gender assignment decisions on the part of the medical community simply unnecessary. In the meantime, further research supporting evidence-based decisions (see Chapter 15) that include the goals of the patient would be very helpful (Consortium on the Management of Disorders of Sex Development, 2006).Advocates for individuals with intersex are encouraging medical professionals to postpone surgical and hormonal treatments until a child is old enough to participate in decisions about their sex and gender.

Interacting with brain development and the child’s ability to move and explore the environment are changes in the way children process information and solve problems. Even when children are exposed to the same information as adults, their thinking often leads them to different conclusions. When asked why clouds move across the sky, a 4-year-old might suggest that the clouds are pulled by airplanes, but an adult is unlikely to come to this conclusion. Both child and adult have observed clouds and airplanes moving across the sky, but viewing these occurrences as related is something that only a small child would do. To understand these differences, we need to examine how cognition changes as a function of age and experience.A preschool child might believe that airplanes pull clouds across the sky, but an adult is unlikely to come to the same conclusion, even though they are watching the same events.One of the classic theories about the development of cognition was proposed by Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget (1896–1980). While working with Théodore Simon, who along with Alfred Binet developed some of the first intelligence tests (see Chapter 10), Piaget became more interested in the errors made by the children than in their correct responses. He believed that these errors were representative of growth in the child’s ability to reason. Later, Piaget’s views were challenged and revised by psychologists who believed that he underestimated the capabilities of children at particular ages. We will explore these contemporary approaches after we look more carefully at Piaget.

According to Piaget’s theory, cognitive abilities develop through regular stages, making Piaget’s work a classic example of the discontinuity approach discussed earlier in this chapter. Cognition matures as the child increasingly uses concepts and organizing schemas to think. We discussed concepts and schemas in Chapters 9 and 10.Two types of adjustments can be made to a schema, depending on the nature of discrepancies between the new information and the existing category. Assume that a child has a rather well-developed schema for birds, which includes features such as has wings, has feathers, and can fly. If the child then learns about a new species of bird, such as a hawk, the child can assimilate the new information into the existing bird schema: Hawks have wings, feathers, and the ability to fly. In assimilationassimilationThe incorporation of new learning into an existing schema without the need to revise the schema.

, no changes to the existing schema are required to add the new instance. However, let’s now assume that the child meets a kiwi, a small, flightless bird from New Zealand. The kiwi doesn’t fit neatly into the existing schema, which assumes that all birds can fly. The schema must be adapted to fit the new information, a process Piaget called accommodationaccommodationThe incorporation of new learning into an existing schema that requires revision of the schema.

. Through accommodation, the child now understands that although most birds can fly, some exceptions occur.Jean Piaget (1896–1980).If children can learn about robins without making changes to their schema of bird, assimilation will occur. In contrast, learning about flightless kiwis might require changes in the bird schema, and accommodation will occur.In addition to his interest in the development and refinement of schemas, Piaget made many other observations about cognition at different ages. We will now explore the particular characteristics found in each of Piaget’s four stages (see Table 11.3).StageApproximate ageHighlightsSensorimotor stageBirth to age 2Here and now rather than past and futureExploration through moving and sensingObject permanencePreoperational stage2–6 yearsLanguage acquisitionEgocentrismIllogical reasoningConcrete operational stage6–12 yearsLogical reasoningMastery of conservation problemsLearning by doingFormal operational stage12 years and olderAbstract reasoningIdealismImproved problem solvingPiaget’s first stage, the sensorimotor stagesensorimotor stageJean Piaget’s stage of development beginning at birth and ending at the age of 2 years and characterized by active exploration of the environment.

, begins at birth and lasts until the child’s second birthday. The name of this stage reflects the infant’s focus on the here and now rather than the past and the future. Sensations immediately evoke motor responses. As soon as they can crawl, infants work their way (usually quite rapidly) through the environment, exploring new objects by interacting with them physically, particularly by putting them in their mouths. Infants do not seem particularly deterred by features such as taste and are very likely to sample the drain cleaner under the sink unless parents take appropriate precautions to babyproof their home.One of the major milestones that occur during the sensorimotor stage is the achievement of object permanenceobject permanenceThe ability to form mental representations of objects that are no longer present.
    
        object permanence
        The ability to form mental representations of objects that are no longer present.
        
    
. Infants under the age of 8 months or so do not seem to be able to form clear memories or mental representations for objects once they are removed from the immediate present. If Piaget covered his gold pocket watch with his beret while an infant watched, the infant would not show signs of searching for the now missing watch. Around the age of 8 months or so, infants become more persistent. If he hid the pocket watch, 8-month-olds would look for it. Object permanence coincides with achieving sufficient growth in the prefrontal cortex (Diamond & Goldman-Rakic, 1989).During the sensorimotor period, the child’s language abilities are developing rapidly. By the age of 18 months, children usually have a working vocabulary of 10 to 50 words, and by the age of 2 years, they are beginning to combine words into short but meaningful sentences, such as Want cookie or Go bye-bye. These new ways of thinking symbolically lead the child into the subsequent preoperational stage.Piaget’s preoperational stagepreoperational stageJean Piaget’s stage of development beginning at the age of 2 years and ending at the age of 6 years and characterized by use of symbols, egocentrism, and limits on the ability to reason logically.

 lasts from approximately age 2 to age 6. The stage gets its name from the notion that children are still incapable of engaging in internal mental operations or manipulations, such as following the transformation of objects from one form to another.Piaget used a variety of creative tasks to demonstrate the characteristics of the reasoning of the preoperational child.

 tasks require the child to recognize that changing the form or appearance of an object does not change its quantity. One of the observations that led Piaget to consider cognitive development as occurring in stages is the rather abrupt way in which conservation tasks are often solved. Children who could not solve the problem a few weeks earlier suddenly look at the adult experimenter with pity, as if to say, This may be the world’s stupidest grown-up.Preoperational children are unlikely to recognize that pouring liquid from one glass to another of a different size and shape does not change the amount of liquid. They usually believe that the glass that is higher holds more. The abruptness with which children master conservation tasks led Jean Piaget to suggest that cognitive development proceeds in stages, but other psychologists believe changes occur more gradually.In addition to difficulty with transitions, preoperational children have limited abilities to understand points of view other than their own, a characteristic described by Piaget as egocentrismegocentrismLimitations on the ability to understand the point of view of other people.

. One kindergarten teacher asked his class where the sun went at night and received an enthusiastic response of Yuba City (which is located in northern California) from one of the students. As it turned out, the young student had moved recently from Yuba City to his current home in San Luis Obispo. Because these were the only two places on earth the child knew, if he was in one place and the sun wasn’t there, there was only one other logical place for the sun to be. You guessed it—Yuba City.Preoperational thinking is also limited by beliefs that appearances are real. While older children understand that movies feature real people dressed up and acting like superheroes, the younger child might believe that not only are superheroes real, but also that they can really fly.The young child’s inability to distinguish fantasy from reality has led to a lively debate about managing entertainment materials for children. Is it appropriate to let young children believe that fairy tales are real?Piaget referred to the stage between the ages of 6 and 12 as the concrete operational stageconcrete operational stageJean Piaget’s stage of development beginning at the age of 6 years and ending at the age of 12 years and characterized by logical but not abstract reasoning.

. Rather suddenly, problems of conservation are easily solved, and thinking becomes more logical. The only remaining limitation is an inability to handle abstract concepts, which will not be resolved until the next and final stage.Piaget used the term concrete operations for this stage because he observed that children reasoned best when allowed to engage in hands-on learning. This observation of Piaget’s has had an enormous impact on the way early childhood education is conducted in many nations. Math instruction now features colorful boxes of manipulatives, which allow children to count and sort real things. Children’s museums, petting zoos, interactive websites, and other opportunities for experiential learning have become commonplace.For Piaget, cognitive development matures in the formal operational stageformal operational stageJean Piaget’s stage of development beginning at age 12 and extending through adulthood and characterized by mature reasoning capabilities

, which begins around the age of 12. The final piece to be added to the child’s cognitive skill set is the ability to handle abstract concepts. Abstract concepts usually involve what if types of questions and form the heart of scientific inquiry. If you were to ask a group of sixth graders what would happen if everyone on Earth became blind tomorrow, they would likely struggle to come up with a reasonable answer. A group of high school students, however, would readily reply that people who were already blind would become instant leaders because they would have existing skills for coping with blindness.Accompanying the ability to think abstractly is a big improvement in problem solving. Younger children tend to approach problems by trying things out and seeing what happens, a rather inefficient trial-and-error approach. Teens are more likely to think through several alternatives more strategically. Abstract thinking ability also appears to stimulate a burst of idealism. What if we could solve world hunger? These are the types of questions teens begin to ask, and they are not always content with the more practical and less idealistic responses of older adults.Piaget’s classic theory set the standard for his time, but more contemporary developmental psychologists argue that some aspects of his view of cognitive development need updating and revising.One of Jean Piaget’s legacies to early childhood education is his emphasis on hands-on learning. Colorful objects or manipulatives have replaced endless worksheets used to teach math concepts such as sorting to older generations of students.Piaget’s strong interest in biology led him to look at human development from a species perspective, which in turn reduced his interest in individual differences. Other psychologists point out that individual cognitive development can be quite variable. Some adults fail to achieve the ability to reason abstractly or do so only on some problems and not on others. This variability makes cognitive development look more gradual and continuous than stagelike, as suggested by Piaget.Piaget did not specify mechanisms responsible for moving from one stage to the next. Today, using brain imaging methods, we can explain some of these changes, such as the correlation between the achievement of object permanence and frontal lobe development. Other transitions, such as the relatively sudden mastery of conservation problems, are not so easily explained.Many psychologists believe that Piaget underestimated the capabilities of young children. At the same time, he might have overestimated the cognitive abilities of adolescents. As we discussed in Chapter 4, the human brain is not fully mature until a person’s early 20s, so we would not expect fully adult cognition in an adolescent.Finally, Piaget has been criticized for viewing developing children in relative isolation from their family, community, and culture. These criticisms have formed the basis for extensions to Piaget’s approach, described in Alternative Approaches to Cognitive Development.

In the next sections, we will explore alternatives to Piaget’s view of cognitive development.An alternative to Piaget’s approach was proposed by Soviet psychologist Lev Vygotsky (1896–1934). Piaget and Vygotsky illustrate the theme of universal versus ecological development introduced at the beginning of the chapter. Unlike Piaget, whose interest viewed human development as universal across cultures, Vygotsky (1934/1962) stressed the role of culture and cultural differences in the development of the child. For Vygotsky, cultures teach children not only what to think but also how to think.A burst of idealism, leading to a desire to make the world a better place, often accompanies the onset of formal operational thinking in adolescence.Piaget’s developing individual learns to understand the world by actively exploring it, like a miniature scientist, whereas Vygotsky’s individual gains knowledge of the world by interacting socially and collaboratively with parents, teachers, and other members of the community (see Figure 11.15). Language was a particularly important aspect of cognitive development for Vygotsky. Children first use language to initiate social contact and opportunities to learn. Later, self-directed talk, such as I need to finish my game before dinner, aids in problem solving and, in the older child, forms inner speech.Unlike Jean Piaget, Lev Vygotsky viewed development as taking place within the social and cultural environments. His zone of proximal development included tasks that the child could learn to do with the assistance of parents, teachers, or other adults or peers. Vygotsky’s advice is to provide children with activities that are within reach but neither too easy nor too hard.Information processing models of cognitive development provide important extensions to Piaget’s theory (Kail & Bisanz, 1991). These models describe specific changes in the child’s ability to reason.The overall rate of processing information, analogous to your computer’s CPU speed, increases during childhood (Cerella, 1994). In tasks that require judgment, such as deciding which of two numbers is larger, adults are three times faster than 4- and 5-year-olds and twice as fast as 8- and 9-year-olds (Kail & Bisanz, 1992). Surprisingly, by the time children enter elementary school, their performance on tasks requiring focused attention and disregard of distracters reaches adult levels (McKay, Halperin, Schwartz, & Sharma, 1994). In contrast, the ability to sustain attention over time remains limited until the age of 11 years. Around this age, attention span begins to lengthen significantly each year until adulthood.Children’s memory abilities change dramatically following their second year of life (Bauer, Larkina, & Deocampo, 2011;  Bauer & Lukowski, 2010). These changes are probably due to maturation of brain structures related to memory. The amygdala and most of the hippocampus are relatively mature at a very early age, around 6 months, but changes in the frontal lobe and hippocampus during the third year of life allow children to form more long-term memories, particularly for sequences of events. Improved memory and a growing sense of self combine to produce some of the first autobiographical memories between the ages of 3 and 5 years (Wang, 2008).Piaget suggested that children’s abilities to understand objects in their world develop slowly over time. Contemporary developmental psychologists believe that this assertion was wrong. Instead, very young children seem to understand a great deal about objects and how they work, even before they have had much experience interacting with them (Baillargeon, Li, Gertner, & Wu, 2011). For example, infants as young as 2-1/2 months old looked longer at an impossible situation (a toy mouse that should have been seen moving between two blocks did not appear), as shown in Figure 11.16.Many contemporary psychologists believe that Jean Piaget underestimated the reasoning abilities of young children. Children as young as 2-1/2 months of age looked longer at this impossible situation (the mouse toy, which is moved from left to right behind the blocks, should have been visible as it passed between the two blocks).Piaget used the concept of egocentrism to describe the young child’s relative lack of awareness of the viewpoints of others. An elaboration of this concept, theory of mind (TOM)theory of mind (TOM)The understanding that others have thoughts that are different from one’s own.

, has emerged as an important tool in tracking typical and abnormal development. TOM occurs when people understand that others have beliefs, desires, and intentions that are different from their own (Premack & Woodruff, 1978). While Premack argued that TOM in humans was an extension of similar abilities in apes, others believed this was a uniquely human ability. Recent research making use of eye-tracking technology, however, has provided stronger evidence that Premack’s observations about apes were correct (Krupenye, Kano, Hirata, Call, & Tomasello, 2016).The classic procedure for demonstrating TOM is the false belief task, often called the Sally–Anne task (Wimmer & Perner, 1983). Imagine that one doll, Sally, places her ball in a basket and then leaves the room. Another doll, Anne, enters the room, moves the ball from the basket to a box, and then leaves. If Sally comes back, where will she look for her ball? Children who have developed a TOM understand that their personal knowledge of where the ball is located is different from the knowledge of Sally, who was absent when the ball was moved. They will correctly decide that Sally will look in the basket (see Figure 11.17).Children who have achieved TOM recognize that their personal knowledge of the whereabouts of Sally’s ball is different from Sally’s knowledge, and they will predict correctly that she will look in the basket.Developmental psychologists generally agree that TOM emerges in children around the age of 3 to 4 years, somewhat earlier than the end of Piaget’s preoperational period. We can identify behaviors in younger children that seem to act as building blocks leading to the achievement of TOM. Joint attention, which includes behaviors such as following another person’s gaze with one’s own and using pointing to direct another person’s attention to something in the environment, emerges in the first year of life (Barresi & Moore, 1996). The ability of young children to distinguish between living and nonliving objects is another important step in the development of TOM. Finally, young children appear to make distinctions between intentional and unintentional behaviors, because 3-year-olds will imitate the former but not the latter (Williamson, Jaswal, & Meltzoff, 2010).TOM appears critical to further social development, the topic of How Do Social and Emotional Behaviors Change During Infancy and Childhood?. A failure to develop a typical TOM has been linked to the development of autism spectrum disorder, a condition characterized by extreme social difficulties that we discuss in more detail in Chapter 14 (Gopnik, Capps, & Meltzoff, 2000).

The physical and cognitive development we have witnessed so far does not occur in a vacuum. Children mature within complex environments affected by their own intrinsic tendencies, the responses to those tendencies on the part of others, and the ways in which they are nurtured.

Children’s temperaments reflect their prevailing patterns of mood, activity, and emotional responsiveness. Differences along these initial dimensions predict adult personality. Mary  Rothbart (2007) divided temperament into three categories: Surgency or extroversion (happy, active, vocal, and social), negative affect or mood (angry, fearful, shy, and frustrated), and effortful control (the ability to pay attention and inhibit behavior).While temperament may predispose a child to interact with the environment in certain ways and affect the behavior elicited from caregivers and others, the environment in which children find themselves also has an impact. For example, fearful children with gentle parents develop a stronger internal sense of right and wrong than do fearful children with punitive parents (Rothbart, 2007). Similar interactions between temperament and parenting have also been reported in rhesus monkeys, emphasizing the possible biological and evolutionary contributions to these outcomes (Suomi, 2006). Rhesus infants with a particular genotype were more aggressive, but only if they were raised by their mothers rather than by peers (see Figure 11.18).In rhesus monkeys, variations in a gene called monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) are related to aggressive behavior. Monkeys with the low-activity variant are typically more aggressive and attain higher rankings within the monkeys’ dominance hierarchy than do monkeys with the high-activity variant of the gene. This relationship is seen when the monkeys are raised normally with their mothers. However, when monkeys are raised in peer groups without contact with their mothers, the relationship is reversed: The monkeys with the high-activity version are more aggressive. This research supports the goodness-of-fit interactions between child temperament and parenting style proposed by Alexander Thomas and Stella Chess and by Mary Rothbart.Temperament interacts not only with the socialization provided by parents but also with the larger-scale socialization provided by culture. In the United States, but not in China, children with higher effortful control showed lower levels of negative affect, such as anger. In China, but not in the United States, higher effortful control was correlated with less surgency or extroversion (Ahadi, Rothbart, & Ye, 1993).

Because of the physical dependency of the human infant on the adult caregiver, maintaining closeness is a high priority. Infants engage in a number of behaviors, such as smiling, cooing, and crying, that are effective in ensuring adult attention.There is a big difference between a newly hatched goose following its mother because of imprinting and the two-way interactions that promote attachment between human mothers and their newborns, including body contact, mutual gaze, and exaggerated facial expressions. Are these more sophisticated interactions exclusively human? Research evidence suggests that the answer to this question is no. Rhesus monkeys also show complex mutual behaviors between mothers and their newborns (Ferrari, Paukner, Ionica, & Suomi, 2009).The Question: Do rhesus monkeys have behaviors that are the equivalent of human mother–infant behaviors that promote bonding?Fourteen mother–infant rhesus monkey pairs were observed while they were living among social groups housed in indoor–outdoor enclosures. Six additional pairs were observed in a more naturalistic setting. For the first 2 months of the infants’ lives, the researchers filmed and recorded the frequencies of mutual gaze (infants and mothers making eye contact) and lip smacking (an important rhesus social behavior).All ethical principles regarding animal research outlined in Chapter 1 would apply here. The observational method used in this study poses little risk of violating these principles.The rhesus infant–mother pairs engaged in frequent mutual gaze and lip-smacking behaviors. The infants spent more time gazing at their mothers than at other individuals, and this time increased with the age of the infant. Lip-smacking behavior was also a frequently observed method for mothers and infants to interact with each other. This behavior is never observed among adults, so it is exclusive to interactions with infants.Mutual gaze and lip smacking both appear to be sensitive to the age of the infant. By the time the infant is in its second month of life, it is spending considerable time outside the mother’s vicinity, much as a human child might do when it attends day care or preschool. As the infant physically separates more frequently from the mother, the frequency of the mutual gaze and lip-smacking behaviors also decreases. The behaviors observed in the enclosed area were confirmed by observations in the more naturalistic setting.Rhesus monkeys show some of the same types of mother–infant interactions, believed to enhance bonding, that have been observed in humans. This finding suggests that behaviors that set the stage for social interactions in humans are not unique to our species but rather have their roots in the evolutionary past.Rhesus monkey mothers and infants show many of the same types of behavior that enhance bonding in human mothers and infants, including mutual gaze.AttachmentAttachmentEmotional bond linking an infant to a parent or caregiver.

 between child and parent is not unique to humans. To identify behaviors leading to attachment between infants and their mothers, Harry Harlow (1905–1981) investigated attachment in rhesus monkeys (Harlow, 1958). The Freudian theories still popular in Harlow’s day suggested that the pleasure obtained through feeding formed the basis of infants’ bond with their mothers. Behavioral approaches suggested that the infant was positively reinforced with food for staying near the mother. Harlow was not convinced by either of these arguments and set out to contrast the mother’s ability to provide food with her ability to provide comfort, security, and safety.Harry Harlow (1905–1981) studied infant attachment by removing baby rhesus monkeys from their mothers at birth and providing them with a wire mother, such as the one shown here, and a similar mother covered with carpet. Regardless of which mother provided food, the infant monkeys spent more time cuddling with the cloth mother than the wire one. Harlow concluded that contact comfort provided by the mother was more important to attachment than the food she provided.After removing newborn rhesus monkeys from their biological mothers, Harlow presented the infants with two surrogate mothers, one made of wire and the other of cloth. Either surrogate could be rigged with a milk bottle, allowing Harlow to investigate all combinations of comfort and feeding. Regardless of which mother provided food, infant monkeys spent most of their time clinging to the cloth mother and ran to her immediately when threatened by a novel toy. The wire mothers were visited only if they provided food, and then for only as long as the infant was feeding. Based on his observations, Harlow concluded that the Freudian and behavioral emphasis on feeding was wrong. Instead, the mother’s ability to provide contact comfort was critical in forming a strong attachment on the part of her infant.A key factor in predicting the timing of attachment appears to be mobility. Young birds that are mobile upon hatching need to form immediate attachments to a protective adult. Human infants, who are not particularly mobile until the second half of their first year of life, have more time to bond with a caregiver. About the same time infants begin to crawl, usually between 6 and 8 months, they also begin to show evidence of having bonded with particular people in the form of separation anxiety (Bowlby, 1969/1982, 1973/1999a, 1973/1999b). Before this stage, infants tolerate being handed around to admiring relatives and babysitters without much protest. Once children demonstrate stranger anxiety, however, they respond to unfamiliar people with crying and distress. Although stranger anxiety might be a nuisance for parents hiring a new sitter or an insult to visiting relatives, it is an important step forward in infants’ social development. The children recognize who does and, more importantly, who does not belong in their social world.Several patterns of attachment between infant and caregiver were demonstrated in classic research by Mary Ainsworth and her colleagues (Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters, & Wall, 1978). Young children in a laboratory playroom were observed through a two-way mirror as their mothers or a friendly stranger left or entered the room. Based on the children’s reactions to these separations and reunions, their attachment to their mothers was classified as either secure or insecure. Children who demonstrated secure attachmentsecure attachmentA pattern of infant–caregiver bonding in which children explore confidently and return to the parent or caregiver for reassurance

 played happily and interacted positively with the stranger as long as their mothers were present. However, when their mother left, the children responded by searching for her, crying, and showing other signs of distress. Efforts by a stranger to comfort the children were rejected. When their mother returned, she was greeted warmly, and the children returned to their play.Secure attachment results from responsive parenting that teaches children that the parent is there for them. Unresponsive parenting teaches children that their needs may or may not be met, so their best strategy is to make regular, frequent, and persistent demands for the parent’s attention.The remaining children demonstrated different patterns of insecure attachmentinsecure attachmentA pattern of infant–caregiver bonding that can take several forms but is generally characterized as less desirable for the child’s outcomes than secure attachment.

. Two of these, avoidant and anxious–ambivalent attachment, were identified by Ainsworth, and a fourth, disorganized attachment, was identified by other researchers (Main & Solomon, 1986). Children with avoidant attachment did not react to their mother’s leaving with distress and allowed themselves to be comforted by the stranger. When the mother returned, the child with an avoidant attachment did not immediately approach her. Children who showed anxious–ambivalent attachment never seemed comfortable, even when their mother was present. Her leaving was greeted with great distress, and the child was alternately clingy and rejecting when she returned. Children with disorganized attachment seemed confused and not well attached. Such children showed contradictory behavior, such as approaching the mother walking backward.Cultural influences on parenting behaviors influence attachment. Psychologists have compared the frequencies of the attachment types in the United States to frequencies in Japan and Germany (Cole, 1999). The Japanese sample had about the same proportion of securely attached infants as reported by Ainsworth but had higher proportions of anxious–ambivalent attachments and zero cases of avoidant attachment. In Germany, the number of anxious–ambivalent infants was about the same as in the United States, but many more had avoidant attachments. The exact features of each culture’s norms responsible for these differences remain to be explored.What types of parenting behavior might foster secure attachment? When you are in public places, such as parks and malls, take a minute to watch parents interact with their children. Some parents are sensitive and responsive to their children’s needs (Cox, Owen, Henderson, & Margand, 1992). The responsive parents are teaching their children that the world is a predictable place in which their parents are there for them when needed. Consequently, these children feel free to explore their environment, knowing that if an emergency arises, they will be able to quickly and reliably obtain assistance from their parents. Small securely attached children have a relatively short radius of exploration, which lengthens gradually as they get older.In contrast, unresponsive or inconsistent parents are teaching their children that the world is an unpredictable place and that the parent may or may not be there for them when needed. In response to such insecure circumstances, children do not venture far from the parent. As suggested by the results of partial reinforcement experiments discussed in Chapter 8, children with unresponsive or inconsistent parents make regular, frequent, and persistent demands for attention because they know that only a small subset of these demands will be met. It might seem counterintuitive, but ignoring children results in clinginess and constant demands for attention, whereas meeting children’s needs promptly and reliably fosters independence.Mary Ainsworth used the strange situation to assess the quality of children’s attachment to their mothers. While watched through a two-way mirror, the child’s mother first leaves and then returns. Using a careful grading scale, researchers rate children as having a secure attachment or one of several variations of insecure attachments.Although American psychologists view a secure attachment to be ideal, attachment might be better viewed with an ecological approach than with a universal approach. Secure attachment is a good model for relatively safe societies (Belsky, 1999). In a safe society, parents have the time and resources to be attentive to children, and exploration is unlikely to put the children in danger. In contrast, secure attachments in dangerous societies might be maladaptive. If the environment is dangerous, parents have less opportunity to be responsive to their children, and exploration might put the children in great danger. The message that The world is an unpredictable place in which we may or may not be able to help you, so stay close might be more realistic under these circumstances.

Not all parents approach parenting the same way. Parenting styles can be divided into four categories that vary along two dimensions: Parental support and behavioral regulation (Baumrind, 1975;  Maccoby & Martin, 1983). Parental support takes the form of empathy and recognition of the child’s perspective. Behavioral regulation involves supervision of the child’s behavior accompanied by consistent discipline and clear expectations (Luyckx et al., 2011).If we look in the upper left-hand box of Table 11.4, we find the authoritative parenting style, a cross between high parental support and high behavioral regulation. This is the ideal style for parents, as evidenced by the superior outcomes among children raised by parents using this style (Milevsky, Schlechter, Netter, & Keehn, 2007;  Simons & Conger, 2007). Limits are appropriate for the age and stage of the child’s development, and consequences are educational, not punitive. Authoritative parents are consistent and firm but also warm and reasonable. They communicate their standards and invite feedback, but there is no question as to who is running the show. High parental supportLow parental supportHigh behavioral regulationAuthoritativeAuthoritarianLow behavioral regulationIndulgentUninvolvedIn her 2011 book Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother, Amy Chua described her initial efforts to raise her daughters in a strict, Chinese fashion instead of a Western style emphasizing self-esteem over achievement, followed by adjustments she made in response to her older daughter’s rebelliousness at age 13. Contrary to fears expressed at the time the book was published, Chua’s daughters seem to be doing just fine. Sophia graduated from Harvard and is studying law at Yale as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army. Lulu is studying art history at Harvard. How do Chua’s experiences fit with our discussion of parenting styles?The upper right-hand box contains the cross between low parental support and high behavioral regulation, or the authoritarian parenting style. The high behavioral regulation provided by these parents prepares children for the limits they inevitably meet in the community from other authority figures such as teachers and law enforcement personnel, but this is considered a less-than-ideal approach in most contemporary environments because of lower levels of warmth and support (Luyckx et al., 2011). Authoritarian parents have a greater tendency than authoritative parents to use harsh punishments, including physical punishment. This behavior can prompt some rebelliousness in the child that is not seen as frequently in response to authoritative parents.In the lower left-hand box, we find the indulgent parenting style, produced by crossing high parental support with low behavioral regulation. These parents are warm and loving, but they simply do not want to be the ones who tell their children the dreadful word no. They are more comfortable letting others, such as teachers, neighbors, and law enforcement, establish rules. Children of indulgent parents are monitored less than children of authoritative and authoritarian parents and show higher levels of antisocial behavior than children of authoritative and authoritarian parents (Luyckx et al., 2011).The lower right-hand box represents the cross between low parental support and low behavioral regulation, or the uninvolved parenting style. This style generally does not occur unless there is something seriously wrong with the family situation. Illness, marital discord, psychopathology, or substance abuse can prevent parents from carrying out their duties in regard to children. By the 12th grade, children of uninvolved parents drink and smoke nearly twice as much as children of authoritarian or authoritative parents, and sons of uninvolved parents are at a very high risk of antisocial behavior (Luyckx et al., 2011) (see Figure 11.19).Authoritative and authoritarian parenting styles are associated with lower rates of antisocial behavior in children than the indulgent or uninvolved parenting styles. However, children with authoritarian parents experience more depression and withdrawal than do children of authoritative parents.Does a parent consistently stay in the same box? The answer to that question is no. Life circumstances can radically change a parent’s style. A competent parent can be thrown off balance by loss of a job, poor health, divorce, or other disruptions. Once the challenging circumstances are resolved, we would expect that parent to get back on track. What if a person’s parents each use a different style? Although this does happen occasionally, most couples share a common style of parenting (Milevsky et al., 2007). If the parents do have differing styles, the presence of one authoritative parent can protect the children from the negative outcomes associated with the other styles (Milevsky et al., 2007).Aspect of developmentHighlightsPhysical developmentHeight and weight increase rapidly.Both gray and white matter in the brain increase.Motor control improves from head to toe and from the midline outward to the periphery of the body.Children select sex-typed toys and use gender pronouns to refer to themselves.Cognitive developmentChildren demonstrate naïve theories.Children learn language rapidly.Assimilation and accommodation of information build better concepts.Thought becomes more logical and abstract.Social and emotional developmentTemperament shapes initial responses to the environment.Children form secure and insecure attachments to caregivers.Parenting styles interact with temperament.

 is an artificial, arbitrary period of development that is a relatively recent phenomenon in human experience. In hunter–gatherer societies, sexual maturity at puberty signaled the young person’s entry into adult roles, privileges, and expectations. Our word puberty comes from the Latin word for adult.Although adolescence is assumed to begin with puberty, its endpoint is less clear. Lifestyle factors associated with adulthood, such as financial independence from parents, separate living arrangements, marriage, and parenthood, are far more descriptive of the end of adolescence than age.Two factors have resulted in an extended period of adolescence in modern, industrial societies, such that it starts earlier and ends later than in the past. One is the dramatic decrease in the age at which pubertypubertyA period of physical changes leading to sexual maturity.

 occurs. Over the last 100 years, the average age of puberty in the United States has dropped from about age 16 to around age 12 (Frisch, 1983) (see Figure 11.20). A second factor contributing to the length of modern adolescence is the extended period of education and training needed in technological societies. Youth at puberty are simply not prepared to assume adult working roles in most modern cultures.Since 1840, the average age of first menstruation, a major indicator of puberty in females, has dropped from nearly 16 years to its current average of 12.6 years.

Physical changes in adolescence provide individuals with their final preparation for taking on adult roles. Among the most striking physical changes in this period are those related to sexual maturity and brain development.The onset of puberty is marked by a cascade of hormone release, culminating in the maturity of reproductive organs and the development of secondary sex characteristicssecondary sex characteristicsPhysical changes occurring at puberty associated with sexual maturity.

. Males experience muscular development, maturity of the external genitalia, growth of facial hair, and enlargement of the larynx, which leads to a deeper voice. Females experience menarche (the first menstrual cycle), breast growth, maturity of the external genitalia, maturity of the uterus, and changes in fat distribution and quantity. The obvious evolutionary purpose of puberty is to prepare an individual for sex, so not too surprisingly, teens respond to the physical changes of puberty with a dramatic increase in sex drive.The physical growth that accompanies the onset of adolescence does not happen to everyone at the same time. Middle school students show a range of physical maturity.Sexual maturation during the teen years parallels further development in gender identity, the assumption of sex-role behaviors, and sexual orientation. Gender identity refers to a person’s sense of being male or female. Sex-role behavior refers to a pattern of traditionally male or female behavior. As we discussed in Chapter 7, sexual orientation refers to a stable pattern of attraction to people of a certain sex, independent of gender identity, sex-role behavior, and sexual experiences.Many complex variations in combinations of these variables occur. People with a homosexual orientation typically demonstrate a gender identity consistent with their biological sex, while showing the same range of variation in sex-role behaviors, from traditionally masculine to traditionally feminine, as people with a heterosexual orientation. Individuals with AIS, mentioned earlier in the chapter, typically develop female gender identity and sex-role behaviors in spite of their genetic male sex (XY). Girls with CAH, who are exposed to much higher levels of prenatal male hormones than typically developing girls, have higher rates of bisexual and lesbian sexual orientations. However, it’s important to note that the vast majority of bisexual and lesbian women do NOT have CAH, and that a substantial majority of women with CAH are heterosexual.Early developmental psychologists, including Piaget, argued that cognition is rather mature at puberty, which in turn implies that the brain is mature. In some aspects, this conclusion is correct. By the teens, areas of the brain that process language, spatial relations, hearing, and other sensory processes appear complete. However, much additional work remains to be done before we can consider the brain to be fully adult. Far from considering the brain complete at puberty, today’s psychologists are viewing the early teen years as being a second critical period of brain growth, the first being prenatally up to age 18 months (Kuhn, 2008).The onset of puberty is accompanied by substantial gray matter growth, which peaks between the ages of 11 and 12 years (Semple, Blomgren, Gimlin, Ferriero, & Noble-Haeusslein, 2013). Following this burst of growth, the gray matter normally thins somewhat over the remainder of the teen years (see Figure 11.21). Abnormalities in this process may be associated with the onset of schizophrenia, described in Chapter 14. Youth with early-onset forms of this disorder show four times more loss of gray matter in the frontal lobes than is usually seen in teens of the same age (Rapoport et al., 1999). White matter, or myelin, continues to mature through the teen years and into young adulthood. Myelination of the frontal lobes is greater in adults 23 to 30 years old than in youth between the ages of 12 and 16. Unfortunately, an adolescent’s white matter is more susceptible than an adult’s to damage, such as that caused by binge drinking (McQueeny et al., 2009).In contrast to early developmental theories such as Jean Piaget’s theory that viewed the mind as mature at the outset of adolescence, gray matter growth continues into early adulthood, although the pace slows, and the cortex thins in some areas. Areas shown in red and yellow are experiencing the greatest rates of growth.In this chapter, we explore the impact of brain development on risk-taking. In general, we find that behaving in risky ways is more typical of teens, in spite of the fact that they perceive risk similarly to adults. How do psychologists know this? We can use instruments like the Domain-Specific Risk-Taking (DOSPERT) Scale (Blais & Weber, 2006). To complete this scale, rate each of the 30 items twice: Once for how likely you would be to do the behavior (your risk-taking score) and then for how risky you think the behavior is (your risk-perception score). Once you have your responses, use the codes at the end of the box to divide your scores into the five domains: Ethical, financial, health/safety, recreational, and social. Add your scores for risk-taking and risk-perception for each domain. You might find that your behavior and perceptions are quite different from one domain to the next.Risk-taking Scale:1234567ExtremelyNot SureExtremelyUnlikelyLikelyRisk Perception Scale:1234567Not at allExtremelyRiskyRiskyAdmitting that your tastes are different from those of a friend.Going camping in the wilderness.Betting a day’s income at the horse races.Investing 10% of your annual income in a moderate growth mutual fund.Drinking heavily at a social function.Taking some questionable deductions on your income tax return.Disagreeing with an authority figure on a major issue.Betting a day’s income at a high-stake poker game.Having an affair with a married man/woman.Passing off somebody else’s work as your own.Going down a ski run that is beyond your ability.Investing 5% of your annual income in a very speculative stock.Going whitewater rafting at high water in the spring.Betting a day’s income on the outcome of a sporting eventEngaging in unprotected sex.Revealing a friend’s secret to someone else.Driving a car without wearing a seat belt.Investing 10% of your annual income in a new business venture.Taking a skydiving class.Riding a motorcycle without a helmet.Choosing a career that you truly enjoy over a more secure one.Speaking your mind about an unpopular issue in a meeting at work.Sunbathing without sunscreen.Bungee jumping off a tall bridge.Piloting a small plane.Walking home alone at night in an unsafe area of town.Moving to a city far away from your extended family.Starting a new career in your mid-30s.Leaving your young children alone at home while running an errand.Not returning a wallet you found that contains $200.Ethical: 6, 9, 10, 16, 29, 30Financial: 3, 4, 8, 12, 14, 18Health/Safety: 5, 15, 17, 20, 23, 26Recreational: 2, 11, 13, 19, 24, 25Social: 1, 7, 21, 22, 27, 28Risk taking and risk perception are negatively correlated in individuals (see Chapter 2). As the perception of riskiness increases, people are less likely to take a risk.Structural differences between the brains of teens and those of adults affect their interpretations of the emotions of other people (Thomas, De Bellis, Graham, & LaBar, 2007; Yurgelun-Todd, 2007). Adults identify expressed emotions accurately, but teens frequently misunderstand the emotions being displayed. Brain imaging demonstrated that the amygdala, which provides a quick, subconscious assessment of emotion, showed the same pattern of activity in adults and teens. However, the adults showed more activity in the frontal lobes than the teens did, which might account for the adults’ superior judgment of emotional expression.The earlier maturation of the more emotional parts of the brain, including the amygdala, relative to the logical frontal lobes might account for some risky behaviors that characterize the teen years, such as reckless and drunk driving, driving without seatbelts, experimenting with drugs, and having unprotected sex. Risky behavior does not result from the teen’s inability to judge what is risky or not (Fischhoff, de Bruin, Parker, Millstein, & Halpern-Felsher, 2010). Instead, teens typically believe that they are somehow immune from the consequences of risky behavior—for example, that drunk driving accidents happen to other people (Reyna & Farley, 2006). The teen brain also responds more vigorously to pleasure than does the adult brain, which means that the immediate pleasurable consequences of a risky behavior can overwhelm the teen’s better judgment (Galvan, Hare, Voss, Glover, & Casey, 2007).

The continuing maturity of the nervous system, interacting with the expanding physical and social environment of the adolescent, leads to more adult ways of thinking and reasoning.Adolescence is when youths apply their new executive strategies to problems and build their knowledge base for specific subjects. High school senior Ronit Abramson won an Intel International Science and Engineering Fair prize for her science project on marine biology.During adolescence, both working memory and reaction time reach adult levels. Adolescents begin to think more logically or analytically (Kokis, Macpherson, Toplak, West, & Stanovich, 2002). For example, children often use their personal experience as a heuristic (the teacher didn’t catch my friend cheating on the test, so it’s safe for me to cheat too) instead of the more logical, statistical reasoning of the teen (my friend might have had a lucky break, but this teacher is extra good at catching cheaters, so my odds of getting caught remain high despite my friend’s experience).Teens are hard at work acquiring data, and as they build up their knowledge bases, their ability to use executive processes such as strategies improves (Peverly, Brobst, & Morris, 2002). As we mentioned in Chapter 9, the more you know about a subject, the easier it becomes to learn new things about it. You acquire skills specific to a subject, such as how to solve statistics problems or prepare for a final covering thousands of pages of reading in your literature course.Our human history and literature are filled with heroes and villains, and we are fascinated by their development. How does one child grow to be Mother Teresa and another to be Adolf Hitler?Lawrence Kohlberg, a student of Piaget’s, attempted to extend Piaget’s theory of cognition to explain the development of moral reasoning (Kohlberg, 1981,  1984). To assess changes in moral reasoning, Kohlberg presented children, adolescents, and adults with a number of ethical dilemmas. He was not as interested in the choice participants would make in response to the dilemma as he was in the reasoning participants provided their choice.Based on the participants’ responses to his dilemmas, Kohlberg identified three major stages in moral reasoning, shown in Table 11.5. Children and young adolescents are typically in the preconventional moralitypreconventional moralityLawrence Kohlberg’s stage at which moral choices are made according to expectations of reward or punishment.

 stage. In this stage, children make moral choices based on their expectations of reward and punishment. Some individuals never progress beyond this stage, even in adulthood, and believe that stealing or cheating is okay as long as they don’t get caught.StageFeaturesPreconventionalUses probability of rewards and punishments to guide behavior.ConventionalMaintains reputation and follows the law.PostconventionalFollows self-chosen ethical principles.Kohlberg believed that during adolescence most of the population moves to the next stage, conventional moralityconventional moralityLawrence Kohlberg’s stage of moral development in which moral choices are made according to law or public opinion.

, and stays there throughout adulthood. In this stage, rules are seen as governing moral behavior and are, therefore, to be followed. Conventionally moral people are also sensitive to public opinion. They want to do the right thing so that others will approve of their behavior. Although conventional morality adds to the stability of a society, it runs the risk of being arbitrary and rigid. In addition, history is full of situations in which local public opinion was supportive of morally abhorrent activities, such as genocide or slavery.The final step of moral development for Kohlberg was postconventional moralitypostconventional moralityLawrence Kohlberg’s stage at which moral choices are made according to personal standards and reason

. Relatively few people, according to Kohlberg, attain this stage. In conjunction with the abstract reasoning of formal operations, the individual now recognizes that rules are made by humans and can, therefore, be flawed. Consequently, personal standards are used as reference points. If everybody used postconventional reasoning to select a driving speed on the highway, chaos would ensue. However, the postconventional thinker is likely to evaluate laws and rules critically before complying with them.Kohlberg is not without his critics. Postconventional reasoning has been criticized as characteristic of males in Europe and the United States, rather than representing a universal stage of moral development (Murphy, Gilligan, & Puka, 1994). Children and adults living in the United States give responses to Kohlberg’s dilemmas consistent with the culture’s emphasis on personal justice and individual rights. Other cultures place a higher priority on interpersonal factors, such as duty and responsibility to others, and these values can lead to different responses to ethical dilemmas (Miller & Bersoff, 1992).

As the teen prepares to transition to adulthood, questions emerge about what kind of adult to be. The focus of social activity begins to shift from the family to the peer group, which is where most adult interaction will be taking place.We pick up social development in adolescence by introducing Erik Erikson, a student of Sigmund Freud who outlined stages of social development beginning in infancy, shown in Table 11.6. Erikson made significant contributions to our understanding of identityidentityA consistent, unified sense of self.

, or a unified, consistent sense of self (Erikson, 1968). For Erikson, social development proceeds in stages, with each stage characterized by a fork in the road between a positive outcome and a less than desirable outcome. Adolescence challenges teens to develop a sense of identity (the positive outcome). If they fail, the result is role confusion (obviously, the less desirable outcome).StageChallengeDescriptionBirth to 18 monthsTrust versus mistrustChildren view the world as a safe, dependable place.18 months to 3 yearsAutonomy versus shame and doubtChildren begin to explore.3–6 yearsInitiative versus guiltChildren begin to act on the world.6–12 yearsIndustry versus inferiorityChildren develop self-confidence.AdolescenceIdentity versus role confusionTeens begin to form an identity by asking Who am I? Failure to achieve a stable identity leads to role confusion and problems with subsequent stages.Young adulthoodIntimacy versus isolationYoung adults with clear identities form stable, intimate relationships, while others experience feelings of loneliness and isolation.MidlifeGenerativity versus stagnationMidlife adults who find value in their lives, even if they have not met all their earlier goals, experience generativity. They are likely to put back energy into family, work, and community.Late adulthoodIntegrity versus despairToward the end of life, adults who feel that they have lived fully experience a sense of integrity and calm.Many teens explore questions of identity by trying on different roles and affiliating with different groups.Teens begin the process of identity formation by asking such questions as Who am I? and What kind of person do I want to be? These are profound questions, made possible by the newly developed abstract reasoning skills of the teen. The answers are not immediately apparent. Considerable exploration may be necessary before the teen discovers a direction. Many teens try on several identities, from jock to nerd to goth, before finding one that works.Because developing an identity can be somewhat unpleasant, teens may be tempted to short-circuit the process. One technique for prematurely adopting an identity is to assume the identity of a group (Erikson, 1968). By affiliating with a particular club, clique, or gang, teens take on a preformed identity and avoid the challenges of finding their individual identities. A second approach is the adoption of ready-made identities provided by parents or other mentors. Although parents may have valuable advice regarding choice of college major and career, these are highly individual choices with significant implications.For many adolescents, ethnic identity, or how an individual feels about being a member of a particular ethnic or racial group, is a major part of their overall identity (see Figure 11.23). Having an ethnic identity boosts the overall self-esteem of adolescents and young adults (Erol & Orth, 2011). A growing number of individuals identify with more than one ethnic or racial group. Psychologists are investigating this multiethnic experience to see what changes might be required in their theories of ethnic identity development (Shih & Sanchez, 2009).Identifying with an ethnic group appears to boost the overall self-esteem of African American and Hispanic teens during adolescence and young adulthood.Running parallel to the search for identity is a tendency on the part of teens to spend more time with peers and less with family. A healthy balance between family and peer influences appears to produce the best outcomes. Teens who continue to interact regularly with their parents, such as having regular dinners together, are more likely than teens who don’t interact much with parents to avoid pitfalls of substance abuse (see Figure 11.24) and promiscuity (Fulkerson et al., 2006).Adolescence is a time characterized by increasing focus on relationships with peers, but strong relationships with family members remain important. Teens who report lower quality relationships with their parents are more likely to use marijuana, alcohol, and tobacco.The importance of the peer group to adolescents can be demonstrated by their heightened sensitivity to peer exclusion. Compared to adults over the age of 22, adolescents reported significantly worse mood following an experimental procedure designed to instill feelings of social exclusion (Blakemore & Mills, 2014). Teens are also more susceptible than adults to negative peer influence. Compared to young adults and older adults, adolescents made many more risky decisions when in the presence of peers than while alone (Chein, Albert, O’Brien, Uckert, & Steinberg, 2011; Simons-Morton et al., 2014).In contrast to popular press accounts of the stormy teen years, most teens (and their parents) navigate their passage to adulthood with no more than a few bumps and bruises (Steinberg, 1997). Generation gaps may occur, but teens typically do not deviate too far from their parents’ values. Research indicates that most teens love their parents, feel loved by their parents in return, share many of their parents’ values, and turn to them regularly for advice.

As we mentioned previously, defining the exact point when a person becomes an adult is not easy. Numerous roles are considered as marking this transition, including the completion of education, full-time employment, independent living, marriage, and parenthood. People do not usually assume all these roles simultaneously, leading to a gradual emergence of adulthood over a period of several years.

The young adult has reached the pinnacle of physical development. If you are in this age group, you are as tall, strong, and fit as you’re ever likely to be. Your brain is mature, and your senses and reaction time are in excellent shape.It is not too early for young adults to consider how to best maintain their physical health. Through childhood and adolescence, we have seen that physical development often follows a blueprint that is strongly genetic. In adulthood, however, lifestyle factors begin to play a greater role in a person’s outcomes. In a longitudinal study of more than 20,000 adults, following four simple steps added 14 years to life expectancy: Eating fruits and vegetables, not smoking, drinking alcohol moderately if at all (fewer than two drinks per day for men and fewer than one drink daily for women), and exercising (defined in the study as 1 hour per week;  Khaw et al., 2008).Becoming a parent is no longer restricted to young adulthood. In 1970, the average age of first-time mothers was 21, and few women became mothers for the first time after the age of 35. Today, many women are postponing parenting until midlife.

In your college experience, you might have seen a professor become annoyed by a student’s inquiry about the right answer. The search for a single answer, however, is characteristic of formal operations as described by Piaget. At this stage of cognitive development, the teen can follow a logical course of steps to solve a problem (Guignard & Lubart, 2006;  Wu & Chiou, 2008). Lack of agreement with the solution is viewed by the formal operational thinker as a sign that the solution is incorrect.Although many questions we face in college have right answers, such as an element’s atomic weight or whether a hypothesis was shown to be incorrect, many more are open to debate. The professor’s frustration with your fellow student’s interest in only one right answer reflects a difference in adolescent versus adult thinking, or postformal thought. Postformal thought recognizes that the right answer is often it depends and that many important questions are complex and ambiguous (King & Kitchener, 2002). Adolescents are more likely to think in absolutes and defer to authorities, such as professors (Perry, 1970). Efforts to move adolescents toward independent, postformal thought are often described as critical thinking exercises, described in Chapter 2.Why is it important to embrace postformal ways of thinking? In Chapter 2, we discussed the importance of generating and testing new hypotheses to move science forward. Using formal operations, a student can evaluate a hypothesis and conclude whether it needs to be rejected. However, postformal thinking is an integral part of creativity, in science or in any other field (Guignard & Lubart, 2006). Scientists who are unable to look beyond the right answers already existing in their fields are unlikely to make creative contributions that stretch that knowledge.

As teens enter young adulthood, Erickson suggests that they confront a new challenge: Intimacy versus isolation. Those who fail to find the level of intimacy they seek might experience feelings of loneliness, which in turn can elicit behaviors that are more likely to alienate others instead of promoting intimacy (Cacioppo, Cacioppo, & Boomsma, 2014). One key to successful intimacy, according to Erikson, is to have established a solid identity in adolescence. If you still don’t know who you are, it is unlikely that you will make good judgments about the type of person who will make you happy.Current trends in the United States include diverse approaches to intimacy and family. In addition to forming traditional families that include two biological parents and their children, large numbers of people are choosing to remain single, live together without being married, be single parents, have children without being married, divorce, and remarry. Along with these changes, public attitudes regarding the question What is a family? continue to change. In the United States, 80% of the public consider an unmarried couple with children to be a family (see Figure 11.26), although only 43% consider an unmarried couple without children to constitute a family (Pew Research Center, 2010).American attitudes about what constitutes a family, a term once restricted to two parents living with their biological children, continue to change and expand to recognize diverse approaches to intimacy.Today’s emerging adults have been classified as members of the millennial and Gen-Y generation, or those born after 1980. Since the time of Aristotle, it has been almost a tradition to despair over the traits of young people. The millennials have been described alternately as the newest greatest generation because of their information-seeking and multitasking abilities but also as generation whine, whose overprotective parents have raised fragile offspring with no tolerance for adversity (Dannar, 2013). Cohorts like the millennials, and the baby boomers and Gen Xers that preceded them, are shaped by their experience. Social trends have the greatest influence on the young (Twenge, 2013). What effects have the last decades had on emerging adults?Jean  Twenge (2013) argues that despite the technology that connects us around the clock, the U.S. culture is becoming more individualistic and self-oriented. Television shows are more likely to focus on fame, books use more individualistic language than previously, and song lyrics are more narcissistic and antisocial. In response to these cultural trends, Twenge argues that millennials show higher rates of narcissism, or an unrealistically positive, inflated view of the self. Narcissistic personality disorder is quite rare, but scores on scales that measure narcissistic traits are increasing (see Figure 11.25).Scores on the Narcissistic Personality Inventory (NPI) have risen since 1990.Increased narcissism has been accompanied by less empathy and more self-oriented behavior, such as increases in elective plastic surgery, cheating in school, and the desire to have authority over others. Narcissism is linked to significant interpersonal problems, including reduced commitment to romantic relationships and increased aggression within those relationships (Keller et al., 2014).Whether you think Twenge is being fair, is there something we could do to reduce narcissism? Twenge argues that efforts to artificially boost self-esteem (see Chapter 12), such as participation trophies and telling everyone they are special, should be abandoned. Instead, she advocates emphasis on building empathy and becoming involved in larger social issues.For those who do choose to have children, the experience of being parents often dominates much of their adult lives. In spite of some stereotypes of miserable parents, parents report feeling happier than nonparents (Nelson, Kushlev, Dunn, & Lyubomirsky, 2014). As is the case with all correlations, however, we cannot conclude that being a parent makes someone happy. Perhaps happier people are more likely to become parents or a third factor might be responsible for both a higher likelihood of becoming a parent and being happy.Although most parents are quite happy with their choice to take on this role, many young couples experience a drop in marital satisfaction as they adjust to new responsibilities (Goldscheider & Waite, 1993). After all, it’s rather difficult to feel attractive for your partner with peanut butter and jelly in your hair. Marital satisfaction decreases when children are quite young and rebounds when children become more independent. Couples who describe their relationships as successful experience milder impacts from having children. Couples’ relationship quality acts as a significant buffer against depression in mothers of children with autism spectrum disorder (see Figure 11.27) (Weitlauf, Vehorn, Taylor, & Warren, 2014).Parenting is tough under any circumstances, but parenting children with special needs puts parents under considerable strain. Mothers of children with autism spectrum disorder are at higher risk for major depressive disorder, but less so when they have strong relationships with their partners.

Just as our criteria for leaving adolescence for young adulthood were somewhat vague, we do not have a set of reliable characteristics that signal the transition between young and middle adulthood. Some people view a specific age, such as 40, as a starting point for midlife. Psychologists often point to physical changes, such as graying hair or menopause in women, as signposts for this new transition. Others suggest that a person’s growing sense of mortality, possibly boosted by the death of a parent, leads to a feeling of being closer to death than to birth (Jaques, 1965).As with the urban myths about the storm of adolescence, you have probably heard popular accounts assuming that we all have some midlife crisis (Levinson, Darrow, Klein, Levinson, & McKee, 1976). For most people, this is simply not true (Rosenberg, Rosenberg, & Farrell, 1999). Middle adulthood is not without its challenges because many adults find themselves simultaneously caring for children and aging parents, working to meet their career and financial goals, and dealing with physical and possibly marital changes. However, there appears to be no evidence for a large-scale crisis associated with any one age.

The major theme of physical and cognitive development in midlife is stability. Assuming that people maintain good health, changes in the physical and cognitive domains tend to be mild and gradual.The most significant physical change in midlife for women is the end of their ability to reproduce. MenopauseMenopauseThe complete cessation of a woman’s menstrual cycles.

 is the point where menstruation stops. For most women, menopause is complete in their early 50s, but loss of fertility is a gradual process beginning many years earlier. Menstrual cycles may become irregular in a woman’s 40s as her sex hormone levels that regulate the cycles begin to drop. During the period of transition between the start of irregular periods and the final disappearance of menstruation, women can experience a number of physical and psychological symptoms. Hot flashes, night sweats, headaches, joint pain, mood swings, and sleep disturbances are common complaints, and the severity of these issues can range from barely noticeable to nearly disabling. Hormone treatments to offset these symptoms are used quite cautiously because they can also increase a woman’s risk of stroke, heart attack, breast cancer, and later dementia (Banks & Canfell, 2009).Men experience more gradual changes in their reproductive status through the remainder of their lives. Sperm quantity may be reduced, but men in their 80s remain half as fertile as men who are 25. Most men experience little to no decrease in testosterone over the course of the midlife years, although other conditions, such as diabetes, can interfere with the maintenance of an active sex life. For both men and women in midlife, the availability of a partner is more predictive of sexual activity than any health issues (Karraker, DeLamater, & Schwartz, 2011).

In contrast to the relative stability in the physical and cognitive domains during midlife, this period of life is characterized by significant changes in social and work roles. Children grow up and move out. If you are the youngest child in your family, you may have noticed that your parents are beginning to feel somewhat more relaxed. For many parents, the empty nest period following their last child leaving home is accompanied by an improvement in marital satisfaction (Birchler, 1992). Your parents no doubt love you, but they’re also relieved to leave many of the responsibilities of parenting behind them. However, as Figure 11.28 shows, the likelihood that negative emotions will accompany an empty nest varies from culture to culture (Mitchell & Lovegreen, 2009).Although most Americans report positive reactions to their last child leaving home, reactions vary across cultures. Among Canadians of different ethnic groups, being an empty-nest parent has different meanings. Parents from Chinese and Southern European cultures are less likely to report negative responses to their last child leaving home than are parents with a British background. Parents from India experienced the most negative response of all groups studied.With increasing life expectancies on one side and later parenthood on the other, many contemporary midlife adults find themselves sandwiched or caring for their aging parents and growing children at the same time.Adults in midlife continue to pursue their careers, becoming more expert, or they might initiate a new career that was not previously compatible with the financial and social responsibilities of raising a family. Recent economic and social changes have made midlife work less stable than it has been for previous generations. Today’s midlife workers express intent to stay employed longer than previous cohorts (at least until age 65), but some find themselves taking jobs below their levels of skill and experience or withdrawing from employment (Elman, 2011).During midlife, Erikson suggests that adults experience either generativity or stagnation. Many people, particularly during adolescence, set a number of goals for themselves. You may want to win a Nobel Prize or the Olympics or simply help others have a better life. Whatever your goals, by the time you reach midlife, you will have a good idea about whether these goals will be met. In many cases, people find that progress has been made toward their goals, although they perhaps didn’t meet them. Wherever an adult finds himself or herself at midlife, the question posed by Erikson is whether value exists. If people feel that their lives have had value, even if they fall short of their goals, they experience generativity. Adults experiencing stagnation, in contrast, have not found much satisfaction in their lives.

As we have seen in our discussion of previous stages of development, the starting point of late adulthood is vague. You might think of age 65, a common retirement age, as a starting point, but many of today’s older adults are living and working longer than ever before and so are thinking about old age differently than in the past. For example, the baby boomers, or individuals born between 1945 and 1964, are more likely than other age groups to choose 72 as the start of old age (Cohn & Taylor, 2010). Current life expectancy at birth in the United States is 78.7 years (Murphy, Xu, & Kochanek, 2013).

Assuming good health, the effects of aging on an adult’s physical status are gradual and rather mild. Nonetheless, some physical change is inevitable, and understanding the nature of these changes provides guidance for coping with them.The brain reaches maturity around age 25, and few further changes occur until about the age of 45. At that time, the weight of the brain begins to decrease, leading to about a 5% decrease by the age of 80 (Anderton, 1997). However, this decrease is not accompanied by dramatic cognitive and behavioral changes. Results from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (2000) show that healthy aging is accompanied by mild changes in the speed of learning and problem solving, and most of these observable changes occur very late in life. As with other physical changes, age-related changes in sensory abilities are gradual, and their effects can be offset by the use of technologies, such as eyeglasses and hearing aids.

Intelligence remains relatively stable during adulthood, as long as general health is good. Although many people erroneously believe that aging is inevitably accompanied by loss of intellect, only about 8.8% of the population over the age of 65 experiences dementia, such as Alzheimer’s disease (Langa et al., 2017). Rates of dementia have been dropping over the last three decades (Satizabal et al., 2016) and nearly 25% between 2000 and 2012 alone (Langa et al., 2017). Improved control of cardiovascular disease and higher levels of education might account for some of these improvements.Fauja Singh, born in 1911, competed in marathons worldwide until his retirement in 2013 as part of the Sikhs in the City team, a group of four runners whose combined age is more than 330 years. Running marathons isn’t necessary to prevent cognitive decline, but people who participate in 20 minutes or more per day of physical activity have the lowest rates of dementia.Certain types of intelligence change more because of aging than others. As we discussed in Chapter 10, crystallized intelligence, or the use of accumulated knowledge, changes less than fluid intelligence, or a person’s basic information processing skills (Horn & Hofer, 1992). Fluid intelligence correlates with speed of processing, whereas crystallized intelligence might be viewed as wisdom, or the ability to draw on past knowledge and experience to solve problems.Early studies of scientific, scholarly, and artistic accomplishments as a function of age demonstrated a peak in a person’s 40s (Dennis, 1966). However, more recent studies show a relatively constant level of professional output. Among professors, research output was far more related to pressure to publish than to a professor’s rank or age (Stroebe, 2010). The average age of Nobel Laureates between 2011 and 2016 was 66 years (Average age for Nobel Laureates, 2017).

In later adulthood, Erikson suggests that people experience either integrity or despair. Older people who are happy with their life’s experiences generally experience integrity (Sneed, Whitbourne, & Culang, 2006;  Vaillant & Koury, 1993). They met their goals for the most part and had a fun time doing so. In contrast, people who reach late adulthood feeling that life passed them by are likely to experience a sense of despair.People turning 65 years of age in 1950 could expect to live about 13.8 more years, or until age 78.8, whereas people turning 65 in 2015 are likely to live 5.5 years longer, or until about age 84.3 (Gatz, Smyer, & DiGilio, 2016). Quantity, of course, does not guarantee quality, so psychologists have investigated ways to improve the well-being of older adults. These investigations have produced valuable results in five domains: Knowledge about healthy cognitive aging, understanding decision-making, ways to encourage good health habits, understanding of stereotypes and bias, and improved adaptive technologies.Not only has psychological research identified neural correlates of healthy and unhealthy cognitive aging, but psychologists have collaborated with legal experts regarding judgments of diminished capacity. As a result, older Americans with cognitive deficits enjoy better protection from abuse, neglect, and financial exploitation (Gatz et al., 2016). Psychology’s contributions to improved understanding of decision-making, particularly the effects of aging on decision making, can assist older adults and those helping them make better decisions related to retirement and medical care.In Chapter 8, we explored basic principles of behavior change related to classical and operant conditioning. Many habits, which respond to behavioral methods, have critical influence on healthy lifestyles, regardless of age. Developing healthy habits and reducing unhealthy behaviors can have significant effects on well-being. In an upcoming chapter, Chapter 13, you will learn more about how stereotyping and biases can have negative influences on the targets’ outcomes. Psychology provides tools for tackling bias among health care providers, such as the willingness of physicians to rate suicidal ideation in 78-year-olds as normal and not needing treatment (Uncapher & Areán, 2000). New technologies, such as social media, have transformed the ability of all age groups to interact with others and seek information. Technologies have the potential to help older adults remain in their homes, but this will require access to digital devices and the knowledge of how to use them.Overall, psychology has already made significant contributions to policy decisions and allocations of resources related to the aging population, and is likely to continue doing so in the future.Grown children and grandchildren play an important part in the social life of many older adults. Unlike other primates, humans live long past their reproductive years, suggesting that grandparents may have historically contributed to the survival of their extended families.You might hold a common stereotype about older adults being sad and lonely. If so, you will probably be surprised to learn that psychological research has found that depression is higher in young people than in healthy, older adults (see Figure 11.29) and that older adults report higher subjective well-being overall than young adults (Carstensen, Isaacowitz, & Charles, 1999). Given the frequent challenges of aging, including physical and cognitive changes, what could possibly account for this increase in emotional well-being? Part of the explanation lies in the way people look at the time they have remaining in life (Carstensen, Fung, & Charles, 2003;  Carstensen et al., 2010). When people see a long stretch of time remaining in their lives, they pursue achievement, possibly at the expense of meeting their social and emotional needs. In contrast, when older adults are looking at a shorter period of remaining life, their goals are refocused toward seeking positive emotional experiences.In contrast to stereotypes about sad, older adults, depression rates are highest in late adolescence and young adulthood and decrease gradually over the life span.One thing that doesn’t change during our journey through the life span is the need for social connection. Older adults show significant benefits from their friendships, but they have fewer of them than younger adults and are less likely than younger adults to form new ones (Rawlins, 2004). Relationships with siblings can be especially meaningful for older adults (Connidis, 1992).Relationships with grown children and grandchildren also form a significant part of the social life of older adults. Historically, many parents entered the role of grandparent during midlife, but with more young adults postponing parenting, the grandparent role is occurring later as well. Humans are somewhat unusual among primates in their length of life span beyond their reproductive years, a phenomenon known as the grandmother effect. A healthy woman might live 40 or 50 years past her age at menopause. It is possible that her contributions to the care of her grandchildren, freeing her children for other tasks, might have provided an adaptive advantage over the course of evolution (Herndon, 2010).Relationships continue to play important roles in the social lives of seniors. Marriage is related to continued good health in seniors.Marriage in late adulthood makes an important contribution to continued good health. In married older adults, interacting with the spouse contributes to happiness by buffering the individual from stress (Waldinger & Schulz, 2010). Seniors who have remained married to the same person for decades have seen many changes in their relationships over the years. We observed earlier that parents of young children experience a drop in marital satisfaction, which improves as children leave the home as young adults. Long-term marriage partners show more similarities with each other because of a lifetime spent in each other’s company, along with a characteristic lack of attention to past negative events and personality traits (O’Rourke & Cappeliez, 2005). In other words, they believe their relationship has been more positive than it was. These couples also show an interesting pattern of conflict avoidance, which contributes to higher levels of marital satisfaction.Getting married and being married can mean different things at different stages in life. One of the more interesting age-related changes in marriage is the impact of similar personalities on a couple’s marital satisfaction throughout the life span (Shiota & Levenson, 2007). Overall, the saying Birds of a feather flock together is quite true, so it is surprising that some similarities in personality are predictive of reduced marital satisfaction and are more so at some life stages than at others. Early in marriage, personality similarities can promote bonding and intimacy. At midlife, however, the focus of the couple often turns to more practical than romantic tasks, such as raising children, advancing careers, and running a household. In this new environment, similarities in the personality trait of conscientiousness are associated with less marital satisfaction (Shiota & Levenson, 2007). The interaction between the highly conscientious person’s drive to finish tasks and the midlife tendency to be a bit less flexible in routine suggests that putting two such individuals under the same roof is likely to produce substantial conflict. We might also speculate that two nonconscientious partners might be overwhelmed by the midlife workload, and the stress resulting from constantly playing catch-up on tasks might take a toll on the relationship. Fortunately, as the family workload diminishes later in life, the married couple’s focus returns to intimacy, and the negative effects of similar personality recede again.We usually think of cyberbullying as something children and teens do, not necessarily something that older adults would do. As a result, we know relatively little about the prevalence and characteristics of cyberbullying by adults.Christopher Bartlett and his colleagues (Barlett & Chamberlin, 2017) surveyed 167 youth (average age of 13.76) and 552 adults (average age of 36.20) to attempt to fill this gap in our understanding of cyberbullying. Results indicated that cyberbullying does indeed occur in adulthood. In general, these researchers found that cyberbullying behavior increased into young adulthood and then decreased with further increases in age. The authors suggest several hypotheses for these findings. First, as we observed in Chapter 10, cyberbullying is most prevalent among individuals who are relatively sophisticated in their use of the Internet and social media. Although the adult sample for this study was recruited using Amazon Mechanical Turk, which implies a reasonable level of Internet competence among the participants, the age groups might have varied substantially in their online sophistication. Second, national law enforcement data cited by Bartlett et al. (2017) demonstrate that antisocial and aggressive crimes are more common in youth than in adults. We discussed several factors in this chapter, such as maturity of the parts of the brain that participate in decision-making, that might account for this finding. As cyberbullying qualifies as an aggressive behavior, we might expect it to follow the pattern of the crime statistics.Many further questions about adult cyberbullying remain. Are the characteristics of the perpetrators the same or different across age groups? Are the motives and objectives similar or different? To what extent do workplace and relationship issues shape cyberbullying by adults?We usually think of cyberbullying as something that happens to teens, but the extent of cyberbullying among adults, especially in the workplace, remains poorly understood.Aspect of developmentHighlightsPhysical changeAdolescents mature sexually and reach adult height and weight.The brain continues to grow through adolescence and into young adulthood.Menopause is a major transition for women in midlife.Among healthy older adults, physical changes are gradual.CognitionWorking memory and reaction time reach adult levels during adolescence.Thinking becomes more logical during adolescence and more independent in young adulthood.Moral reasoning in adults is usually conventional or postconventional.Intelligence remains relatively stable in healthy adults.Social and emotional lifeAdolescents seek to develop identity.Relationships might lead to marriage and parenting in young adulthood.Midlife adults may experience changes in family and work domains.Older adults show significant benefits from social connections.
