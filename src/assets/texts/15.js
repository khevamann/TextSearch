export const text = `Both medication and behavioral treatments reduce abnormal activity in the basal ganglia that is associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder. We have all been told how important it is to wash our hands to avoid illness, especially during flu season. But people with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) might wash their hands several hundred times each day. Why do people with OCD behave this way? Chapter 14 highlighted some possible causes of OCD, including genetic vulnerability and the presence of too much activity in several brain structures, including the basal ganglia. This chapter will discuss how psychotherapists can improve the situations of people with OCD and the other disorders discussed in Chapter 14. The two most common approaches to treating OCD are cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), covered in detail in this chapter, and medications. CBT was developed based on the principles of classical and operant conditioning that were discussed in Chapter 8. In the case of OCD, a woman with hand-washing compulsions could be trained to anticipate when she might feel like washing her hands inappropriately. Then, she would engage in some competing activity—perhaps going out to her garden to pull some weeds or pick some flowers. Finally, she would reward herself for resisting the temptation to wash her hands too much. Is it possible to show differences in brain activity resulting from CBT? The answer is yes (Baxter et al., 1992). Zooming in, we can see what happens to a person’s brain by using a positron emission tomography (PET) scan following therapy for OCD. A PET scan provides a measure of brain activity. The red and yellow areas are considerably more active than the green, blue, and dark areas. When people with OCD who have been treated with CBT are compared to people treated with medication, their PET scans show the same decrease in activity in the basal ganglia. Because medication can produce unwanted side effects and is not effective for all people, it is fortunate that alternate therapies are available. This chapter will explore a number of approaches that have been used to improve the situations of people with psychological disorders. Some represent a variety of psychological treatments, like the behavioral approach to OCD discussed here, while others take the form of medication and other biological treatments. The effects of these treatments might have more in common than you think, as in the case of the changes in brain activity that result from the psychological and biological treatments of OCD. Just as we have argued for the advantages of integrating psychological perspectives to understand behavior and mental processes, the field of clinical psychology is recognizing the benefits of applying multiple perspectives to the treatment of psychological disorders. Chapter 14 explored a diverse range of problems that can contribute to personal and interpersonal distress. Once considered virtually untreatable, many of these disorders respond positively to the treatments available today. Unfortunately, many people with disorders still do not seek help, possibly because of stigma related to having a psychological problem or a lack of awareness that effective help is available (see Figure 15.1). Many people diagnosed with schizophrenia 60 years ago faced a discouraging future of institutionalization and little improvement (see Figure 15.2). Today, although about 30% of patients with schizophrenia do not seem to respond to available treatments, the other 70% experience some relief from their troubling symptoms (Bobo & Meltzer, 2010). As symptoms of depression become more severe, people become more likely to obtain treatment from a psychiatrist or mental health professional, which would include clinical psychologists. It is difficult to tell whether the remaining individuals receive no care or are seen by their family physicians or other health care providers. Scientists are making progress in identifying which patients with schizophrenia are more responsive to current treatments. A deficit group of patients differed from a nondeficit group primarily in having more emotional disturbances. Recovery was defined strictly in this study as no psychiatric hospitalizations, no major symptoms, and at least half-time work or the equivalent level of functioning. In a 20-year study of the patients’ outcomes, using a group of patients diagnosed with depression as a comparison group, the nondeficit group made more progress than the deficit group. Identifying which patients respond to existing treatments will help researchers and health care providers develop more effective treatment plans for individuals. At the same time, significant challenges remain. An analysis of data from Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States between 1990 and 2015 showed that in spite of substantial increases in the provision of treatment, primarily in the form of antidepressant medication, rates of major depressive disorder (MDD) and anxiety disorders did not decrease (Jorm, Patten, Brugha, & Mojtabai, 2017).  Jorm et al. (2017) attribute this lack of progress to a failure to provide quality care to those in greatest need, as well as a lack of attention to preventive strategies. They report no evidence suggesting an increase in risk factors or the effects of greater public awareness. Given the implications of psychological disorders in terms of lost functionality and quality of life, improving preventive and treatment strategies should be given high priority. Psychological treatments, or psychotherapiespsychotherapiesA treatment designed to improve symptoms of psychological disorder through conversation between the therapist and the patient or client.            psychotherapies        A treatment designed to improve symptoms of psychological disorder through conversation between the therapist and the patient or client.            , which generally involve a conversation between the professional providing the therapy and the person seeking help, are often combined with biological treatments, such as the medications described in more detail in later sections of this chapter. For example, a person who is terrified of being part of a crowd might benefit from a combination of psychotherapy and medication for anxiety. As will be shown in this chapter, different combinations of methods can be tailored to different types of problems and to the individuals being treated. Biological approaches to treatment have their roots in our understanding of the biological factors that contribute to psychological disorders. Along with the overall burst of scientific and medical knowledge beginning in the 18th century, scientists began to learn more about psychological disorders and their causes. This knowledge in turn set the stage for the discovery of more effective biological treatments. Improved medical knowledge made psychological disorders less mysterious. When untreated, syphilis (a common type of sexually transmitted disease caused by a bacterial infection) can produce a characteristic set of abnormal behaviors, including hallucinations, delusions, and changes in mood and personality. As noted in Chapter 14, these behaviors are characteristic of a number of psychological disorders, including schizophrenia. The discovery that behaviors like hallucinations could have a biological cause led to the recognition that abnormal behavior can result from infection or other medical conditions. In these cases, the abnormal behaviors should disappear when the underlying medical condition is treated. The use of one biological approach to treatment, medication, revolutionized the care of people with some psychological disorders. In 1949, an Australian psychiatrist named John Cade discovered that lithium salts could produce remarkable improvements in the behavior of patients with bipolar disorder. Cade’s discovery was followed quickly by breakthroughs in the use of medication to treat schizophrenia. Bolstered by these successes with some of the most troubling psychological conditions, the pharmaceutical industry quickly introduced medications for depression and anxiety. These successes not only led to better outcomes for many patients, but also strengthened the credibility of using biological approaches to treat abnormal behaviors. Australian psychiatrist John Cade searched for alternatives to the ECT, lobotomies, and psychoanalysis that were commonly used to treat psychological disorders in the 1940s. After observing that lithium salts had a sedating effect on guinea pigs, he tried lithium on himself to test for side effects. He then tried lithium on his patients and noticed that those with bipolar disorder appeared to respond favorably. Lithium is an element, so it could not be patented, providing little financial incentive for the pharmaceutical industry. However, lithium was approved for use in the United States in 1970. Lithium salts continue to be used extensively to treat bipolar disorder, although we now understand that this treatment has serious side effects. Running parallel to the successes of scientists engaged in biological approaches to disorders were significant contributions from those who focused on the psychological and emotional underpinnings of disorders. During the 19th century, psychologists and psychiatrists were interested in hysteria, a condition that would be diagnosed today as somatic symptom disorder (see Chapter 14). Hysteria did not seem to have any biological basis and did not respond to the medical treatments of the day. Among the first efforts to treat hysteria through nonmedical means was the use of hypnosis by Franz Anton Mesmer (1734–1815), whose name gives us an alternative term for being hypnotized—mesmerized. Mesmer attempted to treat hysteria by inducing a hypnotic state, which was described in Chapter 6. In many cases, people with hysteria no longer experienced their symptoms under hypnosis and, following Mesmer’s suggestions made during hypnosis, continued to be symptom free even after they left the hypnotic state. Franz Anton Mesmer (1734–1815), whose name gives us the term mesmerized, attempted to use hypnosis to treat people with hysteria, which would now fall into the somatic symptom disorders category. Mesmer’s practices inspired Sigmund Freud to use hypnosis, although he eventually abandoned the technique in favor of other approaches. Despite skepticism regarding Mesmer and his techniques, other scientists continued to explore hypnosis, suggestion, and hysteria. When positive outcomes were reported by the noted French neurologist Jean-Martin Charcot (1825–1893), hypnosis and suggestion took on a new legitimacy in the scientific community. Among the admirers of Charcot and his work were Josef Breuer (1842–1925) and his more famous colleague, Sigmund Freud (1856–1939). As will be discussed later in this chapter, Freud eventually abandoned his interest in hypnosis in favor of other approaches, which eventually gave rise to psychoanalysis. Instead of hypnotizing people, Freud encouraged them to speak freely about whatever came to mind. Franz Anton Mesmer’s methods for using hypnosis to treat hysteria were quite theatrical and were denounced as fraudulent by none other than Benjamin Franklin, who was serving as the U. S. ambassador to France at the time. During the 20th century, psychological approaches to treatment reflected the rise of the behavioral and humanistic perspectives, described in Chapters 1, 8, and 12. The behaviorist perspective, unlike the biological and Freudian approaches, focused exclusively on observable behavior and approached the treatment of abnormal behavior using the principles of classical conditioning, operant conditioning, and observational learning, described in Chapter 8. The cognitive revolution of the second half of the 20th century added a recognition of the role of cognitions in abnormal behavior, leading to the development of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Later in this chapter, the use of CBT for disorders such as phobias and depression will be explored. The rise of humanistic psychology in the second half of the 20th century also led to new humanistic therapieshumanistic therapiesA therapy approach patterned after the theories proposed by humanistic psychologists            humanistic therapies        A therapy approach patterned after the theories proposed by humanistic psychologists            . As discussed in Chapter 1, the humanistic psychologists specifically rebelled against psychodynamic thinking and the practice of psychoanalysis. Humanistic therapist Carl Rogers wished to separate his procedures, described in greater detail later in this chapter, from the more traditional Freudian psychotherapies of his time by referring to treatment as counselingcounselingA treatment originally proposed by humanistic therapists that includes a focus on personal strengths and development; the term is now used to refer to treatment for adjustment problems, as opposed to treatment for severe psychological disorders.            counseling        A treatment originally proposed by humanistic therapists that includes a focus on personal strengths and development; the term is now used to refer to treatment for adjustment problems, as opposed to treatment for severe psychological disorders.             rather than psychotherapy or psychoanalysis (Rogers, 1942). Today’s field of counseling psychology mirrors the more positive view of human nature held by the humanistic psychologists by focusing on personal strengths and development. Carl Rogers and the humanistic psychologists rebelled against the practice of psychoanalysis and established new approaches of counseling psychology. The beginning of the 21st century has featured greater demands to tie clinical practice to research on the outcomes of treatment. As shown in Figure 15.3, evidence-based practice (EBP) combines research evidence, clinical expertise, and individual values to provide the best outcome for a patient or client (APA Presidential Task Force on Evidence-based Practice, 2006;  Straus, Richardson, Glasziou, & Haynes, 2005). The movement toward EBP began in medicine, but it has since spread throughout the helping professions, including psychology. Evidence-based practice (EBP) began in medicine and spread to psychotherapy and other helping professions. EBP combines the personal experience of the clinician, the best scientific evidence, and a consideration of patient values and expectations to tailor scientifically valid treatments to the individual. EBP combines five steps (Thyer, 2004). The first is to construct an answerable question, such as Which treatments produce the best outcomes in cases of PTSD? Next, clinicians conduct a search of the most current scientific literature related to the question. In other words, doing something because I’ve always done it this way in my practice is no longer an option. Third, clinicians critically evaluate the relevant literature, using the standards for good science discussed in Chapter 2. This information is then integrated with data regarding particular cases, including the patients’ values and circumstances. Finally, clinicians evaluate their performance based on the patients’ outcomes and make any necessary adjustments. If you think that these EBP steps sound like the problem-solving system introduced in Chapter 10, you’re right. You might have assumed that your health care provider would take this approach automatically, but historically, many clinicians have been convinced that science can do little to assist them with an individual case and that clinical practice was more art than science. Large numbers of clinicians have traditionally valued their clinical expertise over the body of knowledge represented by science (Baker, McFall, & Shoham, 2008). Given the demanding financial realities of health care in the 21st century, however, a logical, scientific evidence–based approach to the delivery of health care services is not just the most effective approach, but also the necessary one. Before therapists can provide any type of useful treatment, they need to understand the problems presented by the person to be treated. The choice of assessment methods is guided by the training and experience of the clinician, but it usually includes the methods described in Chapter 12: interviews, observations, and standardized tests (Groth-Marnat, 2009). A range of professionals, including general medical practitioners, psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, nurses, and religious leaders, provide counseling and psychotherapy. The licensing of these professionals to provide treatment for psychological disorders is administered by state governments in the United States and provincial governments in Canada. Requirements for licensing can vary widely from state to state and can result in a bewildering array of titles. For example, the simple term therapist is not regulated consistently across the United States. We will use the term psychotherapistpsychotherapistA licensed professional who provides psychotherapy.            psychotherapist        A licensed professional who provides psychotherapy.             to refer to any of the many types of licensed professionals described in this section who provide psychotherapy. Benjamin Rush (1749–1813), the father of American psychiatry, believed that psychological disorders were caused by the irritation of the blood vessels in the brain. He invented the tranquilizer chair for patients and wrote a textbook published in 1812, Medical Inquiries and Observations Upon Diseases of the Mind, which was the standard in the field for the next 50 years. PsychiatristsPsychiatristsA medical doctor who specializes in psychiatry and can use medical procedures, such as the prescribing of medication, to treat psychological disorders.            Psychiatrists        A medical doctor who specializes in psychiatry and can use medical procedures, such as the prescribing of medication, to treat psychological disorders.             first obtain a standard medical doctor (MD) degree and then spend an additional three to four years specializing in psychiatry. Because of their training and licensure as physicians, psychiatrists are allowed to perform the medical procedures reviewed later in this chapter, particularly the prescribing of medication. It is difficult to generalize across the entire profession, but psychiatrists are more likely to look for the causes of disorder in biological factors than in learned or environmental factors and to assume that a biological treatment such as medication will be most effective. In addition, the medical model does not see treatment as taking place within a relationship of equals. Instead, expertise is simply transmitted from the doctor to the patient, and little input is expected from the patient. We will see alternatives to this model in the procedures conducted by other types of therapists. The word psychologist is used to describe professionals who have completed advanced degrees in psychology, including those who become psychotherapists. Most psychologists, including the professors teaching your introductory course, earn the traditional academic doctor of philosophy (PhD) degree in psychology, but not all choose career paths as licensed psychotherapists. Clinical psychology is the path taken by psychology graduate students who wish to study, teach, or practice psychotherapy. In addition to completing the academic requirements for a PhD degree, clinical psychology students must spend an additional year providing treatment in a supervised internship. Beginning in the 1970s, an alternative route to becoming a clinical psychologist arose from suggestions that the practice of psychology could be modeled after dental and medical schools (Norcross & Castle, 2002). The doctor of psychology (PsyD) degree was developed to train students to provide services without undergoing the extensive training in research methods that characterizes the PhD degree. Both PhD and PsyD programs can earn accreditation by the American Psychological Association (APA). PsyD programs are becoming increasingly popular with students (see Figure 15.4). However, the lack of emphasis on research that is characteristic of the PsyD degree has led to concerns about the ability of these graduates to think scientifically about their choice of methods (Baker et al., 2008). For example, without a solid background in science, objective evaluation of and adherence to the EBP model could be quite difficult. Of the faculty members in institutions granting the traditional PhD degree, 65% teach scientifically supported CBT techniques (Norcross & Castle, 2002). In contrast, only about 30% of faculty members in PsyD programs teach CBT techniques. While PhD degrees awarded in psychology have remained fairly constant, the number of PsyD degrees has grown dramatically since 1988. There are now approximately equal numbers of clinical PhD and PsyD degrees awarded each year. How do clinical psychologists and psychiatrists differ, other than that they earn different degrees? One of the traditional distinctions has been psychiatrists’ ability to prescribe medication, but that difference is gradually disappearing. In 2002, New Mexico became the first state to allow select psychologists to prescribe medication, followed by Louisiana in 2004 (Daly, 2006), Illinois in 2014, Iowa in 2016, and Idaho in 2017 (APA, 2017). The requirements for already-licensed clinical psychologists to gain prescription privileges are quite rigorous. Psychologists wishing to prescribe medication in these states must go through additional neuroscience coursework and many hours of clinical practicum and physician-supervised hours of care with patients. In addition to treating people with diagnosed psychological disorders, clinical psychologists often provide marriage and family counseling, substance abuse counseling, vocational counseling, grief counseling, rehabilitation counseling, and prison counseling. However, these types of services are also provided by counselors, who typically do not provide services for psychological disorders such as schizophrenia. In other words, a couple experiencing marital conflict might seek either a counselor or a clinical psychologist, whereas a person experiencing hallucinations and delusions is more likely to be treated by a clinical psychologist or a psychiatrist. Counselors hold master’s or doctoral degrees in psychology and related fields, such as education and social work. Students pursuing undergraduate psychology degrees frequently ask what they can do in the mental health field without a graduate degree. About one third of undergraduates in psychology obtain jobs that are closely related to the field (see Figure 15.5). Students completing an undergraduate degree in psychology often work in group homes and camps for troubled youth or in hospital or outpatient settings under supervision. Many others seek work in people-related professions, including human resources, sales, and teaching (see Chapter 1). More workers with master’s degrees in psychology are employed in degree-relevant fields than are workers with bachelor’s degrees. Closely related fields include professional services, teaching, and research. Somewhat related fields include management, sales, accounting, and employee relations. In recognition of the historical role of religious leaders in providing counseling to members of their congregations, most states allow religious leaders to provide this service without further licensure. The master of divinity (MDiv) degree typically includes human development and counseling courses taught at schools of divinity. Some universities offer MDiv degrees that prepare students to be either religious leaders or licensed counselors in the outside community. Among the least frequently regulated practitioners are hypnotherapists, although 30 states and the District of Columbia now regulate hypnotism in some manner. The National Guild of Hypnotists cautions practitioners who are not also licensed health care professionals to use the title Consulting Hypnotist and to avoid using the terms therapy, depression, anxiety, compulsive, phobia, psychological, medical, clinical, and counseling (National Guild of Hypnotists, 2016). As mentioned in Chapter 6, there are many legitimate uses of hypnosis in therapy, and there are many legitimate therapists who use the technique. But that chapter also recounted the example of Zoe D. Katze, who is a hypnotherapist certified by the National Guild of Hypnotists, the American Board of Hypnotherapy, and the International Medical and Dental Hypnotherapy Association. She is a professional member of the American Association of Professional Hypnotherapists. As you may recall, Zoe also happens to be a cat, owned by a psychotherapist named Steve Eichel, who obtained the credentials for her to make a point about the weaknesses of accreditation in this area (Eichel, 2002). Another unregulated area in the provision of psychological services is the field of life coaching, which requires no licensing. According to the International Coach Federation (ICF, n.d.) coaching is defined as partnering with clients in a thought-provoking and creative process that inspires them to maximize their personal and professional potential. Substitute psychotherapy for coaching in this definition, and few would disagree with the resulting statement. Coaches seem to perform the same duties as psychotherapists and counselors. Some psychotherapists have found that referring to themselves as coaches expands their practices, possibly because of the reduced stigma of seeing a coach rather than a therapist in the minds of some clients. Life coaching also provides the advantage of being more appealing to men, who generally seek more traditional psychotherapy in much smaller numbers than do women (McKelley & Rochlen, 2007). Few studies have attempted to evaluate the effectiveness of coaching, but those that have done so note that clients are satisfied with the services (Grant, 2003) and experience improved coping and self-regulation (Theeboom, Beersma, & van Vianen, 2014). Many studies appear in journals that are essentially trade publications, such as the International Journal of Evidence-Based Coaching & Mentoring, the International Coaching Psychology Review, and Coaching: An International Journal. In spite of the lack of regulation and licensure, life coaching is becoming a big part of the delivery of psychotherapeutic services, even within health care settings (Ammentorp et al., 2013). Corporations spend in the vicinity of $1.5 billion per year on workplace coaching services provided by the approximately 30,000 professional coaches who are active globally (Grant, Passmore, Cavanagh, & Parker, 2010). Although licensure provides significant protection for the public, any consumer of psychological services must thoroughly investigate prospective psychotherapists. Zoe D. Katze may be an extreme example, but we suspect that she is not unique. Credentials are not always what they seem. For example, the author of the 1992 best seller Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus lists himself as Dr. John Gray (John Gray’s Professional Bio, 2017), but provides no information on his educational background or licensure. Gray spent nine years as a monk under the leadership of the Beatles’ guru, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. He earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees in the Science of Creative Intelligence from the unaccredited Maharishi European Research Institute in Switzerland, and a PhD degree from the now-defunct and unaccredited Columbia Pacific University in California, which was described by the state government as a diploma mill. Because of his experience as a monk, the state of California recognizes him as a spiritual counselor, which technically allows him to provide advice. More recently, Gray has been joined by his daughter Lauren, who also provides no educational or licensing material about herself on the website. Donald Asher writes and speaks about career hunting, college applications, and résumé building, topics often presented by life coaches. Although unlicensed, coaches also perform many of the same tasks as psychotherapists and counselors. Licensed psychotherapists have found that referring to themselves as coaches rather than therapists reduces some of the stigma that their clients might feel in using their services. So far, we have focused our discussion on credentialing practices in the United States. Worldwide, an even greater variety of professionals perform psychotherapy and counseling under diverse licensure and oversight practices. The United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada provide systems that are similar to those in the United States for delivering psychotherapy (Priebe, 2006). In these countries, psychotherapy is conducted by a number of professionals, including physicians, psychologists, social workers, nurses, and others in similar professions. In each case, performing psychotherapy requires training beyond that needed to simply obtain the appropriate professional degree. Germany and Russia are particularly strict in their accreditation rules. Because of the prevalence of state-run health systems in Europe, assessments of treatment outcomes are regularly conducted (Priebe, 2006). In the United States, treatment outcomes are a question of interest to academic researchers but are rarely assessed as comprehensively as in many other nations, although that circumstance is likely to change with any further government involvement in health care. Celebrity psychologists like Dr. Phil McGraw are often criticized by the profession for offering overly simple versions of psychological advice to the public. Many people imagining a session of psychotherapy think of a stereotypical Freudian scenario. The patient reclines on a couch, while a bearded man sitting in a chair scribbles copious notes. Although some therapy continues to take place in such a setting (though perhaps the therapist isn’t bearded—or a man), many more options are available. Most psychotherapy occurs in the form of individual therapy involving face-to-face, hourlong meetings between the therapist and the patient or client (as a subsequent section will demonstrate, terminology varies among practitioners). In traditional psychoanalysis, such meetings are quite frequent (four to five times per week) and take place over the course of years. In CBT, described in detail in a later section, sessions might occur once per week for about six weeks. Given rates of $150 or more per hour for individual therapy, insurance providers are pressuring psychotherapists to find faster, cheaper, and more efficient ways to provide treatment. Many insurance plans limit psychotherapy sessions to 10 per calendar year. Brief therapyBrief therapyPsychotherapy provided over a short time frame, usually between three and five sessions.            Brief therapy        Psychotherapy provided over a short time frame, usually between three and five sessions.            , another treatment regime, specifically avoids spending long periods searching for the historical basis of a person’s problems. Instead, therapists using this approach focus on solution-building rather than problem-solving (Iveson, 2002, p. 149). Consequently, practitioners argue that only three to five sessions are necessary. Many brief therapy interventions involve only one session, and no cases require more than eight. Many people thinking about psychotherapy imagine a bearded man scribbling notes next to a client reclining on a couch, but this stereotype is usually far from the truth. In addition to individual sessions, psychotherapy can take place with groups of patients or clients in group therapygroup therapyPsychotherapy conducted with a group of people rather than individually            group therapy        Psychotherapy conducted with a group of people rather than individually            . Group therapy does not imply a particular type of treatment approach. Although some treatment approaches seem better suited for group work than others, therapists of all persuasions are known to use groups in their work. The groups formed by the therapist can be homogeneous, in the sense that the group members share a common problem, or heterogeneous, in which the group members have diverse diagnoses. In most cases, groups are limited to between 6 and 12 individuals. People with severe conditions, such as psychotic, suicidal, or antisocial tendencies, are usually excluded from groups until they progress sufficiently to behave as good group members. People participating in group therapy benefit from reduced feelings of isolation. Seeing the progress of others with the same condition raises hope and provides opportunities to model successful strategies. Although many groups are organized and supervised by a licensed psychotherapist, leaderless self-help groups are also quite popular. Weight Watchers, Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), and other groups modeled after AA have become popular sources of support and self-improvement. These groups often operate with a member–leader who is not a psychotherapist, and they function outside the realm of government licensure and supervision. In addition to the obvious cost-effectiveness of having a group split the therapist’s fee, group therapy offers a number of other advantages (Yalom, 1995). For example, group therapy offers hope to the participants, who benefit from seeing others who have made more progress with their condition. Group members also benefit from knowing that others share their condition, decreasing their sense of isolation. Although practitioners generally believe that group therapy is effective, research on group therapy outcomes is difficult to conduct because of the large number of variables that must be considered. The need to control for such factors as different disorders and previous treatment history makes this area challenging for researchers. Family therapyFamily therapyA type of therapy in which family members participate individually and in combination with other family members.            Family therapy        A type of therapy in which family members participate individually and in combination with other family members.            , in which various family members participate in therapy individually and in combination with other family members, is another alternative to the purely individual provision of treatment. Couples therapyCouples therapyA type of family therapy that focuses on intimate relationships            Couples therapy        A type of family therapy that focuses on intimate relationships             is a type of family therapy that focuses on intimate relationships. Family therapy is frequently used when a child or teen is experiencing problems, because these problems typically affect and are affected by the behavior of other family members. Family therapists face a number of significant challenges. In some cases, the member who seems to need treatment the most refuses to participate. In others, maintaining the confidentiality of all participants can be difficult. A teen might disclose information that will help the parents do their job better, but sharing this information with the parents could interrupt the trust that the therapist has built up with the teen. Family therapy combines individual sessions with sessions that include some combination of family members, like these parents and their young daughter. An emerging delivery system for psychotherapy is online therapy. When online therapy is used as a Google search term, more than 11,600,000 results are returned. The benefits of privacy, engaging in therapy from home, and the ability to choose a suitable therapist regardless of location provide significant advantages for some clients. In its early days, online therapy was conducted through e-mail or chat services. Because the written word conveys less information than a therapist obtains face to face, this method could be less desirable. However, many online therapists have taken advantage of Skype and other voice and video technologies. Online delivery of CBT has been shown to be as effective as face-to-face CBT for a number of psychological conditions (Herbst et al., 2014;  Sijbrandij, Kunovski, & Cuijpers, 2016). Other technologies have influenced the delivery of psychotherapy. Therapists can buy products such as Wiley’s TheraScribe, a computer program that includes more than 2,500 prewritten interventions, goals, objectives, and suggested diagnoses. The program generates reports catering to Medicare and other managed care organizations. The time savings provided by these technologies can be useful in controlling costs, but receiving a prewritten evaluation might seem somewhat impersonal to individuals seeking therapy. If you receive a treatment plan from your campus health center that is nearly identical to a friend’s, you might not feel that the counselor cared about you as an individual. Providing treatment for psychological disorders has changed dramatically since the days of Freud. Originally, therapy was provided by individual professionals in small private practices. However, this model became increasingly rare in the latter part of the 20th century, as psychological treatments became more likely to be managed by large organizations, including insurance companies. Many of the concerns about these new models of managed psychological treatment echo complaints from the medical community regarding contemporary medical treatment. Decisions formerly made by the therapist about the types of disorders that warranted treatment and the length, frequency, and type of treatment to be offered are now more likely to be made by insurance company personnel who lack medical or psychological training and focus more on costs (Baker et al., 2008). In addition to the need to adapt to the managed care of psychological disorders, psychotherapy faces many of the same challenges as medicine in providing scientifically valid treatments. Just as we would expect a physician to provide a scientifically supported treatment for cancer, we should expect a psychotherapist to provide equally well-documented treatments for depression. In the earlier section on EBP, we joined most research clinical psychologists and psychiatrists in endorsing the use of science in selecting, implementing, and evaluating psychological treatments. However, as demonstrated in the discussion of the Rorschach Inkblot Test in Chapter 12, lack of scientific support does not always prevent an approach from being widely used. The benefits of privacy, engaging in therapy from home, frequent 24-7 coverage, video interactions using Skype or similar technologies, and the ability to choose a suitable therapist regardless of location provide significant advantages for some clients. Online delivery of cognitive behavioral therapy has been shown to be as effective as face-to-face delivery (Ruwaard et al., 2011). Frustration over the lack of emphasis on science in psychotherapy has led to considerable debate. The American Psychological Association has the primary responsibility for accrediting programs that train clinical psychologists with either PhD or PsyD degrees in the United States. This system has been challenged by a new accreditation body, the Psychological Clinical Science Accreditation System (PCSAS, 2017), which specifically aims to increase the scientific basis of clinical treatment and research literacy among clinical psychologists. Since 2007, the PCSAS has accredited 32 programs, with several more under review (PCSAS, 2017). Time will tell whether PCSAS will be able to nudge the clinical psychology community into greater reliance on research-based methods. Among the barriers to obtaining counseling and psychotherapy services faced by racial and ethnic minority individuals in the United States are cultural distrust, racial and ethnic norms related to self-reliance and privacy, and concerns about culturally sensitive providers (Hayes, McAleavey, Castonguay, & Locke, 2016). Psychologists have begun to identify interventions that might address these barriers by offering greater cultural competency. Among the recommendations for more culturally competent therapy are using interventions that are consistent with the client’s values, communicating in culturally sensitive ways (such as in the client’s native language), expressing empathy and high regard, and avoiding equating cultural differences with deficits. Armed with these competencies, we should be able to identify which therapists and counselors are actually doing a better job of culturally competent counseling. Unfortunately, many early studies depended on perceptions by the client, therapist, or an observer, none of which seem to actually predict positive outcomes of the therapy for the clients.  Hayes et al. (2016) instead suggest that a culturally competent therapist is one who produces the best outcomes. Pursuing this approach,  Hayes et al. (2016) were able to demonstrate that therapists differed in terms of overall competence, regardless of the race and ethnicity of their clients (see Figure 15.6). Some therapists did seem to produce better outcomes with one racial or ethnic group than with others.  Hayes et al. (2016), however, do note that general competence and cultural sensitivity are both very important. They argue that therapist training should emphasize both areas and that the multiculturally expert therapists in their study could serve as excellent role models for other therapists. Zero in this graph indicates no change in Distress Index scores as a result of treatment. The dotted line indicates the mean amount of change across all therapists. The overall most effective therapists were also much more effective with racial and ethnic minority clients.

A psychotherapist who uses psychoanalysis is typically known as a psychoanalyst. Psychoanalysis has not fared well in scientific studies of its effectiveness, although supporters continue to argue in its favor (Leichsenring, 2005;  Lichtenberg, Lachmann, & Fosshage, 2013). The absence of strong evidence for its efficacy has led to a decline in its use. However, psychoanalysis served as an important step to contemporary treatments. Freud’s study featured not only the famous couch, but also Persian rugs and a sample of Freud’s collection of antiquities. Freud’s approach to psychotherapy reflected several key themes from his theory of personality (see Chapter 12). In particular, Freud emphasized the importance of conflict among the self (ego), the aggressive energy of the id, and the restrictions supplied by society (superego). Freud’s view of the ability of the unconscious mind to affect behavior is also central to his therapeutic approach. Because of Freud’s training as a physician, psychoanalysts take a directive role, which means that they are in charge of the session. Like your physician, the psychoanalyst does not expect contributions from you other than information about your symptoms. Freud called his slips faulty actions. For example, a man texting his partner I wish you were her instead of I wish you were here would have a great deal of explaining to do. Modern cognitive psychologists are more likely to blame slips on conflicts between grammar sequences than between the unconscious and the conscious minds. Freud’s psychoanalysis is a classic example of an insight therapyinsight therapyA therapy that improves symptoms of psychological disorder by building people’s understanding of their situation.            insight therapy        A therapy that improves symptoms of psychological disorder by building people’s understanding of their situation.            . Insight therapies assume that people will improve once they understand their problems. For Freud, many psychological disorders arose from problems that resided in the unconscious mind, out of conscious awareness. Although the person might not be consciously aware of these continuing conflicts, the conflicts exert their influence on behavior and through dreams. For example, a patient might arrive at the therapist’s office complaining about her inability to enjoy a satisfactory sex life with a beloved spouse. Although many factors could contribute to such problems, the psychoanalyst is likely to suspect the influence of some traumatic experience that is relatively unavailable to the patient’s conscious thoughts. Perhaps the patient is the victim of childhood sexual abuse, or she might be experiencing a conflict between the ultrastrict morality that she learned from her parents and her current desire to have a fulfilling relationship with her partner. For the psychoanalyst, the cure lies in uncovering the unconscious contributions to the patient’s problems. Once she understands the source of her problems (the insight), her situation should improve. How does one go about uncovering unconscious material? Although Freud experimented with the use of hypnosis to access the unconscious mind, he became dissatisfied with the results and abandoned the procedure. Instead, Freud decided to use the technique of free associationfree associationThe psychoanalytic technique of encouraging a patient to say whatever comes to mind, without attempting to censor the content.            free association        The psychoanalytic technique of encouraging a patient to say whatever comes to mind, without attempting to censor the content.            . Free association occurs when a person says whatever comes to mind. As we mature, most of us become aware that we do not literally speak our mind out of consideration for our fellow humans. Although small children might tell a person, You’re fat, such comments, although they may be true, are not the type that most adults consider polite. We learn to think before we speak. To engage in free association, this self-censor must be turned off, allowing the patient to verbalize those thoughts that are typically withheld. Without the self-censor, the famous Freudian slips might occur and are assumed to reflect unconscious wishes. Not all psychoanalysts engage in dream analysis, but it is likely that therapists interested in dream analysis are psychoanalysts. For Freud, dreaming represented a reflection of unconscious wishes and, therefore, a potential source of useful insight into the unconscious mind. If patients are undergoing dream analysis, they are encouraged to awaken following a dream to jot some notes that can later be reviewed with the therapist, who will attempt to interpret the dream’s symbolic meanings. In addition to reviewing the content of free association, dreams, and Freudian slips, the analyst looks for signs of transference and resistance. TransferenceTransferenceA psychoanalytic technique in which the therapist uses the responses of the patient to the therapist to understand the patient’s approach to authority figures in general.            Transference        A psychoanalytic technique in which the therapist uses the responses of the patient to the therapist to understand the patient’s approach to authority figures in general.             occurs when a patient uses an earlier relationship, usually with a parent or other authority figure, as a prototype for a current relationship, such as that between the patient and the therapist. If the patient begins yelling at the therapist, the therapist might infer that the patient reacted similarly to parents and others in authority under similar circumstances in the past. ResistanceResistance(a) A psychoanalytic technique in which the patient’s reluctance to accept the interpretations of the therapist indicate that the interpretations are correct. (b) The second stage of the general adaptation syndrome (GAS), characterized by coping with ongoing stress            Resistance        (a) A psychoanalytic technique in which the patient’s reluctance to accept the interpretations of the therapist indicate that the interpretations are correct. (b) The second stage of the general adaptation syndrome (GAS), characterized by coping with ongoing stress             occurs when the patient is getting closer to insight. Freud believed that we have unconscious wishes to maintain infantile fantasies and avoid punishment, and that therefore, a patient will resist efforts to uncover this material. Resistance, for the psychoanalyst, can be expressed in many forms. When a patient changes the subject, disagrees with the analyst’s interpretation, or even misses an appointment because of a flat tire, the analyst might suspect that the patient is getting closer to the uncomfortable truth. The Interpretation of Dreams, by Sigmund Freud, was originally published in German in 1900. The 600 copies of the first edition sold slowly, and the publisher did not issue a second edition until 1909. Nonetheless, this book is considered one of Freud’s most influential. In recent years, psychoanalysis has changed in the length and frequency of treatment. Driven by demands from insurance providers, psychoanalysts have developed new, briefer treatments. These briefer approaches tend to be less past-oriented as well. In other words, the psychoanalyst might ask a person about recent experiences at work, rather than about experiences as a toddler. Does psychoanalysis work? Some published meta-analyses suggest that psychoanalysis produces better results than no treatment and occasionally produces results comparable to more modern approaches to therapy (Leichsenring & Rabung, 2008;  Shedler, 2010). However, many of these studies have been criticized on the basis of their methods, such as including Rorschach Inkblot results as measures of patient improvement (McKay, 2011). As mentioned in Chapter 12, humanistic approaches developed in direct opposition to the theories and techniques of Freud and his followers. Where Freud believed that humans are inherently selfish and aggressive, the humanistic psychologists believed that humans are inherently good, possessing natural drives to grow and improve. Society for Freud had a beneficial effect on behavior by providing controls on our selfish and aggressive tendencies. For the humanistic psychologists, society can interfere with growth by providing judgmental feedback. Although we think that dressing and sitting like your client is not necessary to demonstrate empathy, attempting to see situations through the client’s eyes is an important part of humanistic therapies. Not too surprisingly, this conflict in theory led to an equal opposition in treatment approaches. As mentioned previously in this chapter, the psychoanalyst takes a powerful, directive role reminiscent of an MD. The individual seeking therapy is identified as a patient. As in the medical setting, the therapist identifies the nature of the patient’s problems and prescribes a course of action. Other than supplying information, the patient plays a relatively passive role in the process. In contrast, the humanistic therapist is nondirective and treats the person seeking therapy, called a client instead of a patient, as more of an equal in the process. Clients are expected to take an active role in helping to identify their problems and develop a positive course of action. Primary among the humanistic approaches to treatment is the person-centered therapyperson-centered therapyA humanistic therapy approach developed by Carl Rogers to help clients achieve congruence, or an alignment of the real and ideal selves.            person-centered therapy        A humanistic therapy approach developed by Carl Rogers to help clients achieve congruence, or an alignment of the real and ideal selves.             of Carl  Rogers (1942). In place of the psychoanalytic goal of uncovering unconscious sources of problems, person-centered therapy aims to achieve congruence, which was discussed in Chapter 12. For Rogers, discrepancies between the ideal and the real selves, such as when we fail to live up to our ideals, can lead to psychological disorders. Therapy techniques that bring the selves into alignment should treat the disorders effectively. Among the techniques used to achieve this congruence are empathy, unconditional positive regard, and the reflection and clarification of feelings. Empathic therapists attempt to see the world through the eyes of the client, as opposed to imposing their own worldviews. Allowing the client to feel understood in this manner contributes to the establishment of a safe, supportive environment where natural growth can occur. Unconditional positive regard, discussed in Chapter 12, also contributes to the safety of the therapeutic setting. Rogers believed that much human unhappiness resulted from conditional regard, in which children learn that they have value only when their behavior is pleasing to an authority figure. The nonjudgmental, unconditional positive regard of the therapy setting is designed to compensate for those earlier, potentially damaging experiences. Reflection techniques consist of the therapist restating some of the client’s comments in a way that conveys understanding. As such, reflection contributes to empathy and the client’s sense of being fully understood. For example, a client might state that he felt helpless when his boss reprimanded him for losing an important account. The therapist might simply comment, You sound like you were very angry and frustrated when your boss yelled at you. Clarification allows the therapist to point out important insights that the client might have reached. The therapist might clarify the situation with the boss by pointing out its similarities with the feelings that we have as children when we are corrected by an adult. Reflecting feelings takes practice to avoid sounding silly or reverting to the cliché I hear what you’re saying, but you might give it a try the next time someone confronts you. Reflecting the other person’s feelings instead of focusing on your own helps you stay calm, and it’s hard to carry on a one-sided argument with a calm person. Even when psychotherapists use therapy techniques other than a person-centered approach, they frequently incorporate some or all of Rogers’s communication strategies, such as reflection. These strategies also have become quite popular in programs designed to improve interpersonal communication and group process. For example, it is not uncommon for teens to stomp into the house and declare that they hate their parents. The typical response of the parents at that point is to become hurt and angry. The argument escalates as one of the parents retaliates with a hurtful statement, perhaps I wish you were never born! Rogers suggests that such immature battles are easily avoided. Instead of retaliating, the parent might say, I know it makes you very angry when I restrict your privileges, but we had a deal, you broke it, and that means there will be consequences. Reflecting another’s emotions in this way may increase the chances of defusing needless hostility and of coming to a mutual understanding because people will know more concretely that they are being heard. According to the humanistic psychologists, people who learn they have value only when their behavior is pleasing to authority figures can benefit from a therapy setting that features unconditional positive regard. Like psychoanalysis, humanistic approaches to therapy work better in some instances than in others. Rogers referred to his approach as counseling, and his techniques are better suited to problems of adjustment than cases of serious disorders, such as schizophrenia. Efforts to assess the outcomes of humanistic therapy scientifically have been rejected by its followers. For example, one group of proponents argued that natural science methodology should not be privileged over human science methodology (Bohart, O’Hara, & Leitner, 1998, p. 141). By now, you probably understand that we would reject this suggestion and argue instead that science is science, regardless of the phenomenon being examined. Although a small minority of psychotherapists continue to use Freudian or humanistic approaches, most contemporary therapists use other methods. Freud’s psychodynamic theory, humanistic theory, and behaviorism were among the most dominant influences in psychology during the 20th century. We have seen how psychodynamic and humanistic theories were applied to psychotherapy in the form of psychoanalysis and Rogers’s person-centered therapy, so it should come as no surprise to find that behaviorism has similar applications. Given our formal definition of learning as a relatively permanent change in behavior or the capacity for behavior due to experience, it seems logical to use learning as a way to increase the frequency of desirable behaviors and decrease unwanted behaviors in the therapy setting. Behavior therapiesBehavior therapiesApplications of classical and operant conditioning principles to the treatment of symptoms of psychological disorder and adjustment problems            Behavior therapies        Applications of classical and operant conditioning principles to the treatment of symptoms of psychological disorder and adjustment problems             represent applications of classical and operant conditioning to problems of adjustment and psychological disorders. These techniques have proved helpful in both reducing unwanted behaviors and increasing the frequency of desirable behaviors over a range of psychological conditions, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia. The first book to use the term behavior modification in its title was Leonard Ullman and Leonard Krasner’s Case Studies in Behavior Modification, published in 1965. The public initially distrusted behavioral treatment methods because they were based on animal research and assumed that human behavior was relatively simple. The mysticism of the psychoanalysts’ unconscious drives and impulses seemed far more romantic. However, when behavior modification produced successful results in cases that were previously considered untreatable, such as in ASD, respect for the approach grew. Like behaviorism in general, behavior modification, now known as applied behavior analysis (ABA), focuses on what can be observed and makes few assumptions about such unseen factors as the unconscious mind. We can contrast the way that Freud and a therapist using ABA might approach Freud’s case of Little Hans, a 5-year-old boy who had a phobia of horses (Freud, 1909/1976). For Freud, Hans’s phobia resulted from the Oedipus complex issues that were supposedly at their height at his age. Horses, Freud argued, symbolized Hans’s father. The boy had noted that he was especially frightened of horses with black bits in their mouths, which Freud suggested represented the father’s mustache. Freud concluded that Hans’s fear of horses resulted from his unconscious fear of retaliation by the father for sexual fantasies about his mother and would disappear with the resolution of Hans’s Oedipus complex. The subject of Freud’s famous case study of Little Hans was actually named Herbert Graf. Graf grew up to be a successful opera producer at New York’s Metropolitan Opera and the Salzburg Festival in Austria. He is shown here directing the great Marion Anderson as she rehearses for her operatic debut in Giuseppe Verdi’s Masked Ball in 1954. Now it is the behaviorist’s turn. According to classical conditioning theory, phobias can result from conditioned fears. In Hans’s day, horses were the most frequently used means of transportation, especially in large cities. Accidents involving horses were frequent and quite serious. Hans related that he was frightened of horses falling—and with good reason, because it is likely that viewing such accidents would be quite traumatic. Horses could become classically conditioned fear stimuli through their association with accidents and the resulting fear. To reduce the fear, Hans could be gradually exposed to horses in a safe environment (desensitization), rewarded for approaching horses (counterconditioning), or allowed to play with a group of children interacting with a horse (peer modeling). It is not necessary to know why Hans fears the horses to apply behavioral treatment successfully. ABA has been used frequently to reduce unwanted habits. For example, let us suppose that Jennifer would like to stop smoking. The behavior therapist begins by evaluating Jennifer’s current behavior by observing the circumstances in which she smokes. Based on these observations, the therapist might note that Jennifer rarely smokes alone. Instead, her smoking is quite social. If she is at a party or with friends who are smoking, she smokes. The therapist also takes notes of reinforcers or punishers that might be influencing the behavior. Perhaps Jennifer’s friends praise her when she smokes, but her parents get angry when they notice evidence of her smoking. Jennifer’s dentist also might warn her about the poor state of her oral hygiene, which smoking only worsens. Based on these observations, the behavior therapist might attempt a number of techniques that will separate Jennifer from high-risk situations for smoking. She might be encouraged either to gain the support of her friends for her efforts to quit smoking or to spend more time with her nonsmoking friends. Jennifer’s parents might be willing to provide some incentives for her to quit smoking. She could set aside the money that she normally spends on cigarettes for some special treat. Counterconditioning, in the form of asking Jennifer to smoke until she feels sick, is an unpleasant but effective strategy (Lichtenstein, Harris, Birchler, Wahl, & Schmahl, 1973). Behavioral treatments for phobias have been improved with the development of virtual reality for exposing clients to fear-producing stimuli. Researchers at the University of Washington have developed SpiderWorld and successfully demonstrated that participants could reduce their fear of real spiders after undergoing three treatment sessions. The effectiveness of behavior therapies is not restricted to changing negative habits such as tobacco use. As discussed in Chapter 8, token economies, in which reward tokens are later exchanged for preferred rewards, have been shown to increase the frequency of desirable behaviors across a variety of settings, including classrooms, prisons, and institutions (Barkley, 2002; Glynn, 1990). Behavior therapies have helped many people change negative habits. As the name implies, cognitive therapies are based on the notion that the way that we think about our circumstances is essential to our health and adjustment. According to this view, situations do not cause abnormal behavior, but the way that we think about situations might do so. One of the earliest versions of cognitive therapy was developed beginning in the 1940s by Aaron Beck (see Figure 15.7). According to  Beck (1975), people run into psychological trouble when they adopt irrational, self-defeating ways of thinking. For example, it is unrealistic to think that other people will always treat you fairly and kindly, or that you must be perfect to be loved. An important aspect of the therapy process occurs when the therapist attempts to change the irrational beliefs of the client. For example, let’s assume that a therapist is trying to help a group of students who suffer from test anxiety. Each student has an irrational belief that he or she is going to flunk out of school, despite having an adequate grade point average. To help the students realize that this belief is irrational, the therapist might ask each one to provide evidence of the likelihood of flunking out or to identify the worst possible outcome of giving up the belief. Faced with logic, each student begins to substitute a new, rational belief for the old, irrational belief. This substitution of rational for irrational beliefs is termed cognitive restructuringcognitive restructuringA technique used in cognitive therapies in which new, rational beliefs replace earlier, irrational beliefs held by the client.            cognitive restructuring        A technique used in cognitive therapies in which new, rational beliefs replace earlier, irrational beliefs held by the client.            . Increasing interest in CBT is reflected in the number of scholarly articles published on this topic, which has grown substantially over the past few decades. A variation of cognitive therapy emerged from work by Albert Ellis, beginning in the 1950s. Ellis’s version of cognitive therapy is known as rational emotive behavioral therapy (REBT; Ellis, 1975). Compared to many other types of psychotherapy, REBT is somewhat confrontational because the therapist is more openly critical of a client’s thinking. Ellis retained the need to produce cognitive restructuring but deemphasized the supportive role of the therapist. Aaron Beck (1921–), shown here addressing a workshop at the Beck Institute, developed one of the earliest types of cognitive therapies. Beck’s approach featured cognitive restructuring, in which irrational beliefs, such as Everyone must love me or I can’t be happy, are replaced with more rational beliefs, such as I can be happy because I have some people in my life who love me. As cognitive therapy expanded further, therapists began to use the term cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)A combination of cognitive restructuring with behavioral treatments that has been shown to be effective in reducing symptoms of many psychological disorders            cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)        A combination of cognitive restructuring with behavioral treatments that has been shown to be effective in reducing symptoms of many psychological disorders            . In addition to promoting cognitive restructuring, therapists wanted to help clients initiate behavioral changes. For example, a person with major depressive disorder (MDD), as described in Chapter 14, can have irrational beliefs about hopelessness and worthlessness, coupled with behavior that is counterproductive to good mood, such as staying at home in bed watching television. Not only can the irrational beliefs be addressed by CBT, but behavioral methods can be used to encourage the client to take a brisk walk and to provide self-rewards for using more positive, rational patterns of thought. CBT has an excellent record of success, particularly in the treatment of MDD (Dobson & Dobson, 2016). Because CBT typically requires fewer than 16 sessions and can be used for a variety of conditions, it is a favorite among insurance providers. Patient characteristics, the type of problems being addressed, and other variables influence the success of any particular treatment. Consequently, many therapists use the biopsychosocial approachbiopsychosocial approachAn integrated approach to therapy that combines treatments addressing the biological, personal, and social underpinnings of psychological disorders.            biopsychosocial approach        An integrated approach to therapy that combines treatments addressing the biological, personal, and social underpinnings of psychological disorders.            , which combines elements of therapies designed to address the biological, psychological, and social underpinnings of an individual case. The therapist focuses on what works for an individual client, without adopting a single theoretical orientation (Lazarus, 2005). For example, a therapist might find that relaxation training seems to help one client, while role-playing is more effective with another. The major types of biological treatments for psychological disorders include medication, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), psychosurgery, brain stimulation, and neurofeedback. Medication is the most commonly used of the medical therapies. Particularly in the last 60-odd years, the discovery of medications that effectively treated psychological disorders has dramatically shaped the outcomes of millions of patients. A comprehensive review of psychoactive medications is clearly beyond the scope of this text, but we will discuss the use of medication for some specific disorders later in this chapter. The frequent use of medication is not consistent with patient preference. In a meta-analysis of patient treatment preferences for psychological disorders, 75% of the participants preferred psychological treatment to medication (McHugh, Whitton, Peckham, Welge, & Otto, 2013). This preference was particularly strong in younger patients and in women. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)A biological treatment in which seizures are induced in an anesthetized patient; it is used primarily in the treatment of mood disorders that have not responded to medication or other treatments            Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)        A biological treatment in which seizures are induced in an anesthetized patient; it is used primarily in the treatment of mood disorders that have not responded to medication or other treatments             is used in some severe cases of depression that do not respond to other treatments. In ECT, the patient is anesthetized and given a muscle relaxant before the induction of general seizures, which are produced by electricity applied through electrodes on the head. Between 6 and 12 treatments, at a rate of 3 treatments per week, are typically given. A patient is shown being prepared for ECT for serious depression. The patient is anesthetized before electricity is applied through electrodes to the head, inducing seizures. ECT is believed to increase responsiveness to dopamine and norepinephrine and to stimulate neural growth. Ladislas Meduna (1896–1964) recommended ECT for patients with schizophrenia after observing that people who had epilepsy had unusually high numbers of glia and people with schizophrenia had low numbers of glia (Kalinowsky, 1986). ECT was first used with patients with schizophrenia in the 1930s, with poor results. However, observations of improved mood in these patients following ECT led to further use with patients diagnosed with major depressive or bipolar disorder. This procedure is used primarily with patients who do not respond to conventional treatments with medication (Medda, Perugi, Zanello, Ciuffa, & Cassano, 2009). Although the exact mode of action of ECT is unknown, most patients experience an increase in responsiveness to dopamine and norepinephrine, along with the desired reduction in subjective feelings of depression. Although many people have a negative view of ECT (perhaps as a result of reading Ken Kesey’s One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest or seeing the film or play of the same name), ECT is considered as safe as any minor surgery conducted under general anesthesia (American Psychiatric Association, 2001). However, approximately one third of patients experience persistent memory loss following the procedure (Rose, Fleischmann, Wykes, Leese, & Bindman, 2003). This memory loss specifically affects autobiographical memory, discussed in Chapter 9, which can be impaired for at least six months following treatment (Sackeim, 2014). As observed in Chapter 1, the drilling of holes in the skull by ancient people might represent the first effort to use psychosurgerypsychosurgeryThe attempt to improve symptoms of psychological disorders through operating on the brain.            psychosurgery        The attempt to improve symptoms of psychological disorders through operating on the brain.            . Although particular functions might be localized to parts of the brain, it is a giant leap of faith from our current understanding of localization and brain networking to the idea that someone can use psychosurgery to treat psychological disorders. Trepanation has made a bizarre modern comeback in the form of an alternative medicine or elective procedure. People are doing this in their own homes, in a possible variation of the self-injurious behavior discussed in Chapter 8. They argue that the procedure improves brain circulation and metabolism, but research support for such claims is lacking (Moskalenko et al., 2008). Historically, one of the most frequent types of psychosurgery aimed at changing behavior was the frontal lobotomy, which was discussed in Chapter 4. After hearing about the calm that resulted following the procedure in chimpanzees, Egas Moniz encouraged his colleagues to try the procedure on psychotic patients in the 1930s (Valenstein, 1986). Between 40,000 and 50,000 patients received the procedure between the 1930s and the 1950s, sometimes for vague problems such as mild depression in housewives or misbehavior in children (Sabatini, 1997). Walter Freeman popularized the procedure in the United States, traveling in a vehicle that he called his lobotomobile. John Fulton, whose research with chimpanzees had formed the basis for Freeman’s operation, was horrified. What are these terrible things I hear about you doing lobotomies in your office with an ice pick? he asked Freeman. Why not use a shotgun? (Kopell, Machado, & Rezai, 2005, p. 192). As we have emphasized in several contexts in this textbook, the frontal lobes participate in some of the highest-order cognitive functions carried out by the human brain. Consequently, the deliberate damage to the frontal lobes and their connections to other parts of the brain involved with the lobotomy procedure has harmful effects on a person’s judgment, personality, initiative, social behavior, and sense of self. Despite the outrage among many in the medical community, frontal lobotomies were performed well into the 1960s, until the use of medications for psychological disorders became an established practice (Sabatini, 1997). Today’s psychosurgery is far removed from the lobotomy procedure. Radiation and precise lesions are used to treat small numbers of people with MDD or OCD (Kopell et al., 2005). Walter Freeman (1895–1972) performed more than 3,400 lobotomies at $25 per procedure, despite having no formal training in surgery. Although this procedure is considered barbaric today, Freeman enjoyed the respect of many of his colleagues, serving as cofounder and president of the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology from 1946 to 1947. He nominated his mentor, Egas Moniz (1874–1955), for the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine, which Moniz won in 1949. Brain stimulation has a number of advantages over psychosurgery. Most importantly, the effects are usually reversible. In contrast, once the brain has been damaged by psychosurgery, there is no going back. Following observations of mood changes in people undergoing deep brain stimulationdeep brain stimulationElectrical stimulation applied through surgically implanted electrodes that is used to treat some anxiety and mood disorders.            deep brain stimulation        Electrical stimulation applied through surgically implanted electrodes that is used to treat some anxiety and mood disorders.             through surgically implanted electrodes for the relief of Parkinson’s disease, physicians attempted to use stimulation to address OCD and MDD. Microelectrodes are surgically inserted into specific parts of the brain, and in many cases, the patient controls the application of any current (Mayberg et al., 2005). A total of 50% of patients with severe depression who had not responded to more conventional treatments achieved improvements in mood following stimulation of the nucleus accumbens (Bewernick et al., 2010). In Chapter 4, we indicated that the nucleus accumbens was part of a circuit that processes feelings of reward. Stimulating this area improved patients’ mood and led to their engagement in more pleasurable activities. After the successful use of deep brain stimulation for Parkinson’s disease, the method was used to treat people with depression. The image on the right shows where an electrode was implanted in this woman’s brain. Deep brain stimulation requires surgery to implant the microelectrodes. Repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) provides an alternative way to stimulate the brain without surgery. When applied through a handheld device touching the scalp, low-frequency magnetic pulses change activity in underlying cortical regions. This technique has been recommended for use in MDD (Speer, Wassermann, Benson, Herscovitch, & Post, 2014; also see Figure 15.8) and some cases of schizophrenia, but it appears to have a negative effect in cases of OCD (Slotema, Dirk Blom, Hoek, & Sommer, 2010). Compared to participants with depression undergoing a placebo version of rTMS (sham rTMS), participants receiving active rTMS showed significantly reduced scores on the standard Hamilton Depression Rating Scales. Participants showed rather strong placebo effects in the sham condition (note the drop in depression at week 2), which emphasizes the need for placebo-controlled studies in assessing the effectiveness of all types of treatment. Neurofeedback, a type of biofeedback training that focuses on brain activity, has been used to treat ADHD in children. As mentioned in Chapter 4, biofeedback training allows participants to gain some conscious control over some otherwise unattended physical functions. For example, people can be taught to overcome white coat hypertension, or the classically conditioned spike in blood pressure that occurs when a nurse or doctor (in a lab coat) takes a measurement. By learning to relax instead of becoming tense in this situation, people can reduce their blood pressure, which is not a process that we typically try to control. NeurofeedbackNeurofeedbackA type of biofeedback used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and seizures by teaching the client to keep measures of brain activity within a certain range.            Neurofeedback        A type of biofeedback used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and seizures by teaching the client to keep measures of brain activity within a certain range.             is a type of biofeedback that concentrates on the activity of the brain. Recordings of brain activity, usually obtained from electroencephalography (EEG) but increasingly from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), are usually displayed for the participant, who is trained to keep readings in a desired range. In most cases, people are not consciously aware of what they are doing to comply. So far, however, rigorous studies have not provided strong support for the efficacy of EEG neurofeedback in the treatment of ADHD, ASD, OCD, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and MDD (Begemann, Florisse, van Lutterveld, Kooyman, & Sommer, 2016). Consequently, few insurance providers will cover this type of treatment.

This section will outline the typical approaches to the psychological disorders discussed in Chapter 14. All therapy approaches discussed previously in this chapter have been applied to the treatment of children and adolescents. However, special care must be given to the use of biological therapies in childhood and adolescence because of the possible adverse effects of these treatments on the development of the nervous system. Although ASD is accompanied by abnormalities in the neurotransmitters serotonin, GABA, and glutamate, no medications have proved effective in alleviating core symptoms of the disorder (Pardo & Eberhart, 2007). This lack of a beneficial result does not mean that medications are not prescribed in cases of ASD. Two antipsychotic medications have been approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in ASD and appear helpful in severe cases involving aggression, tantrums, and self-injury (Fung et al., 2016;  Posey, Stigler, Erickson, & McDougle, 2008). Unfortunately, children treated with antipsychotic drugs experience the same side effects as adults, including weight gain, diabetes, motor dysfunction, and immune system problems. Antidepressants and several other types of drugs are commonly prescribed for children with ASD off-label, which means that the drugs have not been officially approved for this purpose on the basis of research demonstrating effectiveness (see Figure 15.9). Although only two medications (antipsychotic medications typically used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder) have been approved by the FDA for use in treating ASD, large-scale studies show that many other medications are routinely prescribed by physicians for children with ASD. Alpha agonists are usually prescribed for high blood pressure and have a sedative effect. In this sample, 35.3% of the children had at least one prescription, and 9% had three or more drugs that they were taking simultaneously. The most commonly used psychological treatment for ASD is applied behavior analysis (ABA), which builds on the principles of operant conditioning outlined in Chapter 8 (Smith & Lovaas, 1998). ABA focuses on observable, socially important behavior such as language and should produce lasting improvements that generalize to settings outside the therapy setting (Baer, Wolf, & Risley, 1968). ABA in the treatment of ASD often involves therapy that takes up most of a child’s waking hours, which is a large investment for families in terms of time and resources. As shown in Figure 15.10, although studies are complicated by the child’s initial level of functioning and many other variables, meta-analyses of the outcome of intensive, early-childhood behavioral interventions show a strong positive effect of treatment on language acquisition, but more moderate effects on social skills and daily functioning (Virués-Ortega, 2010). A meta-analysis demonstrated that early behavioral intervention in ASD produced measurable improvements in IQ scores, language, and daily living. High-intensity treatment (measured by hours per week) seemed to have the greatest effects on IQ, but duration of treatment seemed to have the biggest impact on language. Most clinical psychologists suggest that an effect size of 1 for a treatment means that the treatment is very effective. Parents and teachers of individuals with ASD are anxious to find new methods for improving academic, communication, employment, and leisure outcomes. Subjective observations might lead us to think that computers—or better yet, mobile devices like tablets and smartphones—would be perfect for this purpose. But do the results of scientific research demonstrate true benefits? The answer, happily, appears to be yes (Kagohara et al., 2013). A review of 15 studies carefully selected based on the strength of their methodology demonstrated that mobile technologies have advantages for the person with ASD. The most frequent uses of mobile technology were using the device to access preferred stimuli, such as snacks and toys, which might otherwise be difficult for individuals with language delays. In cases of severe language disability, the devices could generate speech that would allow the individual to request preferred stimuli. Other uses included videos that teach specific academic skills, such as how to use the spell-check function of a word processing program. Video modeling of skills can be useful, given the reluctance to engage in face-to-face instruction that characterizes this disorder. Using an iPad to improve math skills produced mixed results (O’Malley, Lewis, Donehower, & Stone, 2014). However, students in this study who used the math app were more likely to complete their work with fewer prompts on the part of the teacher. Technology also offers potential relief from the high cost of face-to-face applied behavior analysis (ABA) treatment in cases of ASD. Randomized trials are currently underway using an iPad-based behavioral intervention called TOBY (Granich et al., 2016), which is intended to compliment, not replace, conventional therapy. The overall advantages of using these technologies include people’s ability to advance at their own pace with minimal supervision. At the same time, use of the devices should not substitute for face-to-face contact because such interaction is essential to improvements in behavior in individuals with ASD. However, social skills themselves might be the object of mobile apps. The evaluations of apps specifically designed to enhance children’s creative, expressive, and collaborative social activities seem encouraging, but the use of apps for this purpose needs further study (Hourcade, Williams, Miller, Huebner, & Liang, 2013). Research supports the use of tablets and other mobile technologies for improving the skills and behaviors of children with ASD. Because of the severity and lifelong nature of ASD, parents of children with this disorder are especially vulnerable to so-called cures that have little research support. Dietary interventions have become popular in recent years, but these appear to have few benefits. People with ASD show evidence of excess peptides from gluten (found in wheat) and casein (found in dairy products), but controlled studies do not demonstrate benefits from restricting these foods (Millward, Ferriter, Calver, & Connell-Jones, 2008). Chelation treatments designed to remove heavy metals from the body are also popular but lack research support (Weber & Newmark, 2007). Even worse, at least one child died from this type of treatment because a physician substituted a toxic chemical for the correct one with a similar name (Sinha, Silove, & Williams, 2006). Hyperbaric oxygen therapy, usually used to treat the bends in scuba divers, has not been shown to improve ASD symptoms in spite of Internet claims to the contrary (Granpeesheh et al., 2010;  Xiong, Chen, Luo, & Mu, 2016). Among the other treatments that are advertised to parents are sensory integration treatment, massage, music, special diets, and animal-assisted therapies. Many children with a diagnosis of ADHD are treated with medication, either alone or in combination with behavior therapy (Storebø et al., 2016). The use of medications for attention problems resulted from an accidental discovery. Charles Bradley used a stimulant (benzedrine sulfate) to treat a group of children hospitalized for learning and behavior problems (Bradley, 1937). He noted that during the week that the children used the drug, half demonstrated a spectacular improvement in school performance (p. 584). The most commonly prescribed drugs for ADHD are the closely related stimulants methylphenidate (Ritalin), dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine or Dextrostat), and a combination of amphetamine salts (Adderall). These drugs increase the activity of dopamine and norepinephrine. Most patients tolerate these medications well, but side effects of weight loss, sleep disturbance, and higher heart rate and blood pressure can occur. If children take the medications continuously for long periods, growth can also be suppressed. Methylphenidate does produce tolerance, and patients should stop the drug under medical supervision rather than on their own (Ross, Fischhoff, & Davenport, 2002). Although it is chemically quite similar to amphetamine, methylphenidate is not considered an addictive drug, given its slower action on the brain (Volkow, Wang, Fowler, & Ding, 2005). Individuals who do not respond well to the stimulant drugs are often treated with nonstimulant drugs that increase norepinephrine activity (Prasad & Steer, 2008). Charles Bradley observed the behavior of 30 institutionalized children, who had a variety of problem behaviors, after they were administered a type of amphetamine used at the time for asthma and other breathing problems. Bradley’s observations about the children’s spectacular improvement in school performance, as well as their becoming emotionally subdued, led to the modern treatment of ADHD with stimulant medication, including other types of amphetamine. It might appear odd to treat a disorder that often features hyperactivity, or high levels of impulsive behavior, with a stimulant. Wouldn’t it make more sense to try medications that have a calming effect? The rationale for stimulant treatment of ADHD suggests that impulsive hyperactivity occurs if the parts of the brain responsible for planned, thoughtful behavior, such as the basal ganglia and frontal lobes, are not active enough. Raising the activity in these areas theoretically should reduce impulsive behavior. One of the common myths about medications for ADHD, however, is that they are ineffective in people who do not have the disorder. This is not the case, and medications prescribed for ADHD are commonly abused (Arnsten, 2006). The use of medication for ADHD in the United States is five times higher than in any other nation, leading to criticism of the practice (see Figure 15.11). An unusual percentage of published research reports on the efficacy of medication has been sponsored directly by the pharmaceutical industry, leading to concerns about possible bias (Storebø et al., 2016). Approximately 75%–80% of children treated with medication alone experience significant short-term improvement on ratings of social compliance and sustained attention (Barkley, 1995). Research has not demonstrated long-term benefits of stimulant use on later outcomes in adolescence and adulthood (Leo & Feldman, 2007). In other words, children with ADHD treated with medication do not enjoy superior outcomes later in life compared to children with ADHD who do not receive medication. This map of medication use for ADHD from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows the same regional variations that were observed in Chapter 14 for the prevalence of ADHD diagnoses. Together, these data suggest that about half of all children diagnosed with ADHD are prescribed medication. The use of medication produces short-term improvements in about 75%–80% of children with ADHD. However, children with ADHD who are treated with medication are no better off in adolescence or adulthood than children with ADHD who were not treated with medication. College students are not the only ones using ADHD medications inappropriately. A survey in the prestigious scientific journal Nature found that 65% of the scientists who responded knew a colleague who used methylphenidate or similar drugs without a prescription for the purpose of improving focus and concentration (Maher, 2008). Although medications are widely prescribed, behavioral methods for treating ADHD can be helpful. In particular, behavioral parent training, which builds the skills of parents of children with ADHD to use operant conditioning methods effectively, and behavioral classroom management, which applies learning principles in the school setting, are especially effective (Pelham & Fabiano, 2008). Another behavioral approach featuring peer-focused treatments in recreational settings also has shown promise (Evans, Owens, & Bunford, 2014;  Pelham & Fabiano, 2008). Unfortunately, it is often difficult to maintain the consistency needed for successful behavioral intervention without a great deal of cooperation among teachers, parents, and others working with the child. Before the 1950s, effective treatment for schizophrenia was virtually nonexistent. Patients were often subjected to odd treatments that had no basis in any scientific understanding of their condition and that were frankly dangerous in some cases. They were forcibly restrained in lukewarm baths with canvas covers that prevented their escape. Insulin shock therapy, in which injections of insulin were used to place patients in daily comas, enjoyed a brief fad status, as did the frontal lobotomy, discussed earlier in this chapter. The discovery of effective medications for schizophrenia was accidental. A French surgeon, Henri Laborit, was impressed by the calming effects of the phenothiazines. He experimented with one of these drugs, chlorpromazine (Thorazine), to reduce stress and shock in his surgical patients. Based on his promising results, Laborit encouraged his psychiatric colleagues to try the drug on their psychotic patients, which they did with dramatic success. A new era of treatment began. Largely as a result of this new type of treatment, institutionalized populations dropped by about 50% in the United States between 1955 and 2000 (see Figure 15.12). People responding well to medication could now return to their communities instead of living in institutions. The percentage of the U. S. population that was institutionalized in asylums because of mental disorders was cut almost in half in the years following the discovery of antipsychotic medications. Initially, nobody understood how phenothiazines reduced psychosis. One clue came from the fact that high doses of the drug produced symptoms similar to those of Parkinson’s disease, such as muscular tremor. Parkinson’s disease was known to result from the degeneration of motor neurons that used dopamine as their primary neurotransmitter. Further research indicated that phenothiazines acted as dopamine antagonists, blocking dopamine at the receptor site. Phenothiazines are not without their share of problems, though. Nearly one quarter of patients with schizophrenia do not respond to these drugs (Kane & Freeman, 1994). The drugs successfully reduce psychotic symptoms, such as hallucinations and delusions, but are often less effective in reducing negative symptoms, such as social withdrawal and emotional disturbance (Buchanan, Breier, & Tamminga, 1995). To address these deficits of phenothiazines, often called typical or first-generation antipsychotic medications, newer atypical or second-generation antipsychotic medications, such as clozapine (Clozaril), were introduced. Approximately half of all contemporary patients with schizophrenia are prescribed the atypical antipsychotics (Meltzer, Bobo, Lee, Cola, & Jayathilake, 2010). These newer drugs are often more effective than phenothiazines in treating the negative symptoms of schizophrenia because they affect a wider range of neurotransmitters, including serotonin. All antipsychotic medications produce significant side effects. Tardive dyskinesiaTardive dyskinesiaA movement syndrome that results from the use of medications used to treat symptoms of schizophrenia.            Tardive dyskinesia        A movement syndrome that results from the use of medications used to treat symptoms of schizophrenia.            , (tardive means slow and dyskinesia means difficulty moving) is a syndrome that results from the use of antipsychotic medications by some patients. The syndrome produces tremors and involuntary movements, especially of the face and tongue. These problems often continue even when medication stops. Although risk of tardive dyskinesia seems lower with the second-generation antipsychotics (Leucht et al., 2013), these drugs have their own set of side effects, including diabetes, weight gain, reductions in white blood cell count, aggravation of existing cancers, and seizure disorders. Medications used for schizophrenia often produce in patients a movement disorder known as tardive dyskinesia. This patient is experiencing the intrusive, involuntary movements and tremors that characterize this condition, which is usually permanent. Newer medications for schizophrenia are somewhat less likely to produce tardive dyskinesia but have their own side effects, including diabetes, weight gain, reductions in immune system functioning, aggravation of existing cancers, and seizure disorders. Most individuals with schizophrenia are treated with medication, but psychological treatments still have much to offer. The World Health Organization (WHO) noted that people with schizophrenia in developing countries, such as Nigeria, India, and Colombia, were recovering more frequently than patients in the United States and Europe (Hopper, Harrison, Janca, & Sartorius, 2007). Further research suggested that improved outcomes occur when patients remained in their homes and were given opportunities to do meaningful work. These observations led to the increased use of psychosocial rehabilitation for patients with schizophrenia (Bustillo, Lauriello, Horan, & Keith, 2001). This approach emphasizes providing opportunities to do meaningful work, social skills training, education about schizophrenia and the importance of medication, affordable housing linked to services, and information about symptom management. The primary method of treating bipolar disorder is the use of medication. The most commonly prescribed medication is a simple salt, lithium carbonate. Not only does lithium prevent recurrences of mania, but it is uniquely preventive of suicidal behavior (Alda, 2015). Lithium’s actions remain poorly understood. In general, lithium appears to protect individuals from neurodegeneration (Alda, 2015). Lithium has antioxidant effects (Jornada et al., 2011) and appears to both promote the birth of new neurons and prevent further loss of neurons (Quiroz, Machado-Vieira, Zarate Jr, & Manji, 2010). Administration of lithium in patients with bipolar disorder results in increased gray matter relative to patients who are not treated with lithium (see Figure 15.13 and Figure 15.14). Newly diagnosed participants with bipolar disorder were randomly assigned to groups treated with lithium or valproic acid, which is also used to treat bipolar disorder. Over the next 16 weeks, these groups were compared to healthy controls using no medications. Gray matter volume increased in the group treated with lithium but did not change in the healthy controls or in the group treated with valproic acid. These results support the ability of lithium to increase neural growth, which might also explain its effectiveness in treating bipolar disorder. These images compared gray matter density between (a) patients with bipolar disorder using lithium treatment and control participants and (b) patients with bipolar disorder who were not using lithium treatment and control participants. As indicated by the colors (blue = little to no difference and red/white = statistically significant difference), the patients taking lithium experienced considerable growth in gray matter density in many areas of the cerebral cortex. Unfortunately, lithium carbonate has a number of unpleasant and potentially dangerous side effects. Toxic levels of lithium produce nausea, vomiting, muscular tremor, coma, and seizures. Because of these risks, patients must have regular blood tests to monitor their lithium levels. The unpleasantness of these side effects also contributes to the poor compliance with their treatment plan that characterizes patients with bipolar disorder. These patients are less likely to follow treatment instructions than any other kind of patient on any other type of medication (Sajatovic, Valenstein, Blow, Ganoczy, & Ignacio, 2007). Other medications, including antipsychotics, are used in treating bipolar disorder but do not appear to be as effective as lithium in reducing hospital admissions (Joas et al., 2017). Psychosocial rehabilitation for schizophrenia includes opportunities to do useful work. Socializing with peers, engaging in healthy outdoor physical activity, and earning a paycheck contribute to the clients’ personal growth. Research demonstrating that bipolar disorder is more common in nations in which consumption of seafood is low, discussed in Chapter 14, has led to suggestions that omega-3 fatty acids in the diet might provide some protection from bipolar disorder (Noaghiul & Hibbeln, 2003). Lower levels of omega-3 fatty acids have been observed in patients with bipolar disorder (Balanzá-Martínez et al., 2011). The use of omega-3 supplements improves symptoms of depression in these patients, but it does not seem to have much effect on the symptoms of mania (Grosso et al., 2014). While not a substitute for treatment with lithium, the benefits of omega-3 fatty acids are obtained without side effects. You have probably noticed that this discussion of treating bipolar disorder has not emphasized psychotherapy. Most individuals with bipolar disorder appear to require medication for the alleviation of their symptoms, and psychotherapy alone is not typically considered an option. However, psychotherapy aimed at assisting individuals and their families with coping with bipolar disorder and adhering to treatment is often beneficial. Even in conditions like bipolar disorder that have strong bases in biology, integrating several perspectives when selecting treatment approaches can produce superior outcomes. Given the range of suspected causal factors in depression, it should not surprise you that treatment approaches are diverse. Treatments range from medical, to cognitive, to behavioral, to simple aerobic exercise, and combinations of these approaches are common. The most popular method for treating MDD today is the use of medication. Antidepressant medicationsAntidepressant medicationsA medication designed to alleviate symptoms of depression, but often prescribed for other types of conditions            Antidepressant medications        A medication designed to alleviate symptoms of depression, but often prescribed for other types of conditions             are the third most common prescription drug taken by Americans (Pratt, Brody, & Gu, 2011). As shown in Figure 15.15, about 10% of Americans over the age of 12 years use antidepressants. Rates of antidepressant use in the United States increased nearly 400% between 1988 and 2008 (Pratt et al., 2011). Keep in mind that antidepressant medications are often prescribed for conditions other than MDD, such as anxiety disorders. This is still a remarkable number of prescriptions and raises the distinct possibility that, like barbiturates and benzodiazepines before them, antidepressants are being overprescribed. In addition, studies have shown that these medications are effective in severe cases of MDD, but they do not show benefits compared to placebos in mild to moderate cases (Khan & Brown, 2015). Antidepressant clinical trials as a whole have small (0.30) effect sizes, even when severely depressed individuals are included in the sample (Khan & Brown, 2015). This means that use of the medication explains a small portion of the variation in patient outcomes, including the extent of improvement. Use of antidepressant medication in the United States is high, with one in ten over the age of 12 years and more than one in five 40-59 year old females using these medications. The most widely prescribed antidepressant medications are the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which include popular brands like Prozac and Zoloft. As their name implies, these medications increase serotonin activity at the synapse by interfering with reuptake of the neurotransmitter, a process discussed in Chapter 4. As a result, more serotonin is available in the synapse (see Figure 15.16). The use of SSRIs is based on a belief that MDD results from unusually low serotonin activity and that therefore, boosting serotonin activity should improve mood. These drugs achieve this effect by interacting with the serotonin transporters located in the membrane of the neuron releasing the serotonin. This interaction slows the rate of reuptake, or the process by which the neuron retrieves and repackages the molecules of serotonin that it has just released. In addition to inhibiting the reuptake of neurotransmitters at the synapse, antidepressants provide further benefit by increasing the number of neurons in the hippocampus—at least in rats (Nasrallah, Hopkins, & Pixley, 2010). Stress and depression both appear to reduce the number of neurons found in the hippocampus, and the administration of antidepressants may not only halt this loss, but also promote the birth of new neurons in this area. Results from experiments with rats showed a 20%–40% increase in neurons in the hippocampus in response to the administration of antidepressant drugs. These medications have their share of risks and side effects too. Increases in thinking about suicide following use of SSRIs, especially among children and youth, have prompted stronger warnings for close supervision by attending physicians (Hall, 2006;  Wessely & Kerwin, 2004). Other side effects of SSRIs include nausea, reduction of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, headache, weight gain, and sexual dysfunction. Between 30% and 60% of patients treated with SSRIs report problems with sexual activity (Gregorian et al., 2002). SSRIs reduce the activity of nitric oxide (NO), the gaseous neurotransmitter that helps maintain erections in men and genital engorgement in women (Yu et al., 2003). In contrast, erectile dysfunction medications, such as Viagra and Cialis, act by boosting NO activity. When patients fail to respond to medication, other biological treatments might be used to treat MDD, such as ECT, deep brain stimulation, or rTMS (Demitrack, 2007;  Mayberg et al., 2005; O’Reardon et al., 2007). In addition to biological treatment options, a number of psychotherapy alternatives are quite successful in alleviating depression and have the added benefit of producing no adverse side effects. One of the most popular approaches is the use of CBT. As described previously, this approach combines the restructuring of negative cognitions (Nobody loves me becomes Not everybody loves me, but some people do) and behavioral techniques aimed at increasing the person’s activity level and social skills (Beck, Rush, Shaw, & Emery, 1979). Between 40% and 60% of people with MDD treated with CBT not only experience relief from their symptoms, but also appear to be less susceptible to repeated bouts of depression than people who use medication alone (Hollon, Thase, & Markowitz, 2002). People who are depressed also benefit from adding aerobic exercise to their routine (see Figure 15.17). For cases of mild to moderate depression, exercise produces effects comparable to medication and psychotherapy, and it complements these treatments in cases of severe depression. Because people who are depressed face higher risks of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, exercise is a valuable addition in terms of patients’ physical health as well. Participants with MDD who had not been previously treated were randomly assigned to medication alone, exercise alone, and medication plus exercise groups for a 12-week study. Because the participants were randomly assigned to groups, there were no statistically significant differences in the severity of their depression before treatment. All three treatment groups experienced improvement in their symptoms, as shown by their reduced scores on the Beck Depression Inventory. Although it appears that the medication group might have improved more than the exercise and combination groups, the differences between these three groups were not statistically significant. Therefore, we can conclude that exercise alone was equally effective in reducing symptoms of depression as medication alone or medication in combination with exercise. Although our methods for treating mdd are typically effective, there is a significant risk of recurrence. Some individuals experience low rates of recurrence when continuing to take antidepressant medications, even when their depressive symptoms are gone. However, these medications produce significant side effects, making this approach undesirable for many people. Continuation of CBT after recovery is typically more helpful than continuing to take medication, but many health plans pay for only limited numbers of sessions. Recurrences of depression might occur because people who have experienced episodes of MDD think differently than people with no history of depression when a mildly negative mood state occurs (Teasdale et al., 2000). A technique known as mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) combines aspects of CBT and mindfulness-based stress reduction. The idea of MBCT is to teach people to detach from depression-related thoughts and feelings by endorsing statements like Thoughts are not facts and I am not my thoughts. How well does this approach work to prevent repeated episodes of MDD? The Question: Does the addition of MBCT to MDD treatment produce better outcomes than treatment as usual alone? In a study, 145 patients in recovery from MDD were randomly assigned to continue with their treatments as usual or to receive additional MBCT training. Their progress at a 1-year follow-up was assessed. Treatment as usual meant that the patients would seek help as they normally would, perhaps from a family doctor, if they experienced mood difficulties. Participants assigned to receive MBCT training attended eight weekly 2-hour group training sessions and completed daily homework exercises. Key themes included empowerment, freedom of choice, and awareness of experience in the moment. Patients as participants require additional protections. Making treatment as usual available ensures that no participants are left untreated. Referrals to appropriate services should be provided to all participants, and confidentiality should be maintained with great care. Among participants with three or more previous episodes of depression, who made up 77% of the sample, the addition of MBCT reduced recurrence rates by nearly 50% compared to treatment as usual alone. This study indicated that MBCT provides a powerful tool for preventing further episodes of depression—a finding that has since been replicated and supported by a significant amount of research (Khoury et al., 2013;  Warren et al., 2016). The use of MBCT has been extended successfully from the treatment of MDD to the treatment of anxiety and stress (Khoury et al., 2013). Anxiety disorders, including GAD, phobias, and panic disorder, are typically treated by using medication, CBT, or a combination of the two (see Figure 15.18). Medication, exposure therapy (in which the individual is gradually introduced to anxiety-producing situations), and combined medication and exposure therapy appear to produce approximately equal improvement in the functioning of people with social anxiety disorder. Scores of social functioning of people randomly assigned to these treatment conditions were significantly better than scores of the placebo group after 24 weeks of treatment. However, when treatment was discontinued after 24 weeks, the functioning of the groups that received medication and medication combined with exposure therapy deteriorated at the 1-year follow-up assessment, whereas the exposure-alone group continued to improve. These results suggest that patients choosing to use medication should continue treatment to maintain gains in functioning. As discussed in Chapter 14, anxiety is associated with a heightened level of brain activity because of anticipated danger. Consequently, most efforts to medicate anxiety attempt to reduce brain activity, or produce a tranquilizing effect. Because GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, a common method for slowing brain activity is to enhance its effects. As described in Chapter 6, many substances, including alcohol, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines, interact with the GABA receptor to produce stronger inhibition in the brain. Each of these types of substances produces a tranquilizing effect on the brain. Because these drugs have additive effects with one another and work at the same receptor site, taking combinations of these drugs is frequently fatal because of a life-threatening level of brain inhibition. Knowing that one of the motivations for alcohol use might be to reduce the anxiety resulting from social events and other stressors can be helpful in avoiding problem drinking. If a person feels like she can’t face a situation without being drunk, it would be more positive to seek professional help than to continue drinking. Barbiturates, developed in 1903, continue to be quite useful in the treatment of seizures, but their use as a treatment for anxiety is no longer considered desirable. They were one of the first of several medications used for psychological treatments to become vastly overprescribed. By the mid-1960s, enough barbiturates were being made to provide every American man, woman, and child with 40 to 50 doses per year (Regan, 2000). The addictive properties of barbiturates, as well as their frequent use in suicides, were definite drawbacks. The discovery of benzodiazepines after World War II changed the treatment of anxiety dramatically, but like the barbiturates, the benzodiazepines became overused. By the 1970s, chlordiazepoxide (Librium) and diazepam (Valium) were the most frequently prescribed drugs of their day. Alprazolam (Xanax) remains a widely used benzodiazepine, typically prescribed for panic disorder, GAD, and premenstrual syndrome. In some cases, alprazolam seems to be helpful in treating MDD, but its mechanism for doing so is not understood. You might think that tranquilizers would be a logical medication for treating anxiety disorders. Although these drugs are used occasionally, the antidepressants discussed in a previous section of this chapter are typically more effective. This result might reflect a common underlying cause for both depression and anxiety. Behavioral and cognitive behavioral techniques are commonly used to treat anxiety disorders and have the advantage over medication of having no side effects. Phobias, for instance, can be treated with exposure therapy, in which the person is gradually exposed to the fear stimulus or to other people interacting harmlessly with the fear stimulus while the person relaxes. Medication and psychological treatments produce similar levels of improvement for cases of anxiety (Baldwin et al., 2014). OCD can be treated with antidepressant medication, CBT, or a combination of both. CBT for OCD involves training the person to anticipate compulsive behavior and then to engage in a competing behavior. As mentioned earlier, a compulsive hand-washer could go outside, away from faucets and soap, to do some gardening. Meta-analyses show that CBT is a highly effective approach to treating OCD (Olatunji, Davis, Powers, & Smits, 2013). As you have seen in this chapter, administering therapies for psychological disorders and problems with adjustment is typically the domain of highly trained professionals. However, there are a few activities that people can do safely on their own to reduce stress and change habits. Chapter 8 outlined a method that you could use to change unwanted habits based on behavioral therapies. This box reviews a progressive relaxation technique that you can use to reduce stress. These same techniques are often implemented to produce relaxation during exposure therapy. To enhance your ability to relax, it is often beneficial to make an audio recording of the instructions. To begin, put on some loose, comfortable clothing and either lie down on your back or sit in a chair with your head supported. Breathe slowly and deeply. Each muscle group is tensed for 5 seconds (silently count one–one thousand at a normal speaking pace), followed by a pause of 20 seconds, during which you relax the muscle group and think of tension draining from that part of the body. The procedure can be repeated for more dramatic relaxation. With practice, you should be able to will yourself into a relaxed state rather easily. Here is the order of muscle groups to tense and relax: Tense the muscles of your head and face. Tense the muscles of your neck (gently). Tense your elbows and biceps for 5 seconds, and then relax and straighten your arms. Clench your fists tightly. Tense the muscles of your chest. Tense the muscles of your stomach. Tense the muscles of your calves. Tense the muscles of your feet and toes (gently, to avoid cramping). If you are successful in achieving deep relaxation, someone should be able to pick up your arm or leg and it will be limp and unresisting. Tensing and then relaxing each muscle group in the body leads to a deep state of relaxation. CBT is particularly helpful in cases of body dysmorphic disorder (Allen & Woolfolk, 2010). Cognitive restructuring can help the individual think more realistically about perceived physical flaws. Many individuals with this disorder, however, insist on continued treatment by cosmetic surgeons and resist suggestions that they should obtain psychotherapy. PTSD is typically treated using exposure therapy with or without SSRI medications (Le, Doctor, Zoellner, & Feeny, 2014). Because many people with PTSD also develop a variety of substance use disorders, additional treatment addressing these disorders is necessary for full recovery (Back et al., 2014). You might expect virtual reality (VR), the presentation of realistic stimuli through a device worn on the head, to be more exciting to video gamers than to therapists. However, this new technology is showing remarkable promise for the treatment of phobias and PTSD. As discussed in this chapter and in Chapter 8, one of the best ways to address these stress- and fear-related problems is to combine relaxation with a controlled exposure to the fear-producing stimuli. This application of classical conditioning was popularized by Joseph Wolpe in the 1950s (Wolpe, 1958). For example, people who are afraid of heights could imagine progressively more stressful situations (climbing a ladder or visiting the Empire State Building) while remaining relaxed. Eventually, the fear of heights should be reduced. Imagination is a wonderful capability of the mind, but it has its limitations. This is where VR comes in. Instead of asking a client to imagine a situation, the scenario can be presented in a realistic way through the use of VR technology. As our height-phobic client maneuvers through elevators, construction sites, and other high places, wind, vibration, and sound can be added to make the visual experience even more realistic. In addition to treating phobias, VR is being used to help combat veterans recover from PTSD (Spira et al., 2006). In these cases, odors from diesel fuel and gunpowder can be added to enhance the reality of the virtual experience. The U. S. Army is testing Virtual Iraq, a 360-degree, interactive, computer-generated environment, as a treatment for soldiers with PTSD. Soldiers are able to relate their traumatic experiences to the therapist, who can then program the environment to reproduce weather conditions, terrain, helicopter flyovers, types of attacks, and sound. Soldiers treated with VR are being compared with soldiers treated with other traditional psychotherapy approaches and a control group of soldiers on the waiting list for treatment. Research comparing the effectiveness of VR therapies, alone or in conjunction with traditional CBT, suggests that VR therapy alone is about as effective as CBT alone in treating phobias, but the former might have an advantage in certain situations, such as fear of flying (Krijn et al., 2007). VR also performed well in comparisons with CBT in cases of PTSD (Baños et al., 2011). In particular, VR therapy appealed to people with PTSD who were unwilling to undergo more traditional treatments. People who grew up playing video games might find the VR approach more effective and comfortable. The treatment of dissociative identity disorder can be quite controversial, as is the diagnosis of this condition, explained in Chapter 14. Some psychotherapists work on the assumption that dissociative identity disorder is a valid diagnostic category that often results from serious trauma (childhood sexual abuse in particular). Treatment is aimed toward integrating the various personalities by first identifying and working through the traumatic memories related to the disorder (International Society for the Study of Trauma and Dissociation, 2015). Hypnosis is commonly used by these therapists to assist in the recovery and resolution of traumatic memories, but this practice is not supported by scientific research. Under hypnosis, a suggestible person might be vulnerable to the manufacture of false memories, and individuals identified as having dissociative identity disorder appear to be far more suggestible than the general public (Frischholz, Lipman, Braun, & Sachs, 1992). In one notable case study, a woman sought therapy to cope with a traumatic event involving her daughter. Her psychiatrist employed hypnosis and convinced her that she had experienced horrific abuse as a child and now had more than 120 separate personalities (including one that was a duck), thereby illustrating the influence that therapists can have on the memories that they help recover (Loftus, 1997). A particularly damaging finding regarding the state of treatment for dissociative identity disorder is the suggestion that individuals labeled with the disorder subsequently show even worse symptoms (Piper & Merskey, 2004). Critics of the dissociative identity disorder classification suggest that psychotherapists should restrict their actions to resolving the stress, anxiety, and depression of the individual, without referring to dissociation. Both biological and psychological treatments are commonly used to treat somatic symptom disorders, which involve physical symptoms such as pain that have no apparent physical basis. Among the biological treatments for somatic symptom disorders are medication with antidepressants and increased physical activity. Psychological treatments usually take the form of CBT (Allen & Woolfolk, 2010). Complicating the treatment of these disorders, most of these patients are seen by their primary physicians, and relatively few are willing to pursue psychotherapy. Between 50% and 80% of patients referred for psychological treatment by their physicians do not comply, possibly because of their continued belief that they have a real medical condition that has not yet been appropriately diagnosed (Allen & Woolfolk, 2010). British painter Kim Noble has been diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder. This disorder is characterized by the experience of two or more personality states. Noble paints quite differently when she feels that she is in a particular personality state as opposed to others and believes that she has improved her well-being by expressing her perceived personalities through her art. Finding effective treatments for antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) has a high priority, given the extent of harm that individuals in this category can inflict on the rest of society. Unfortunately, effective treatments remain elusive (Bateman, Gunderson, & Mulder, 2015). No known medications specifically reduce antisocial behavior, although many incarcerated individuals are treated with tranquilizing drugs, including antipsychotic and anticonvulsant medications (such as barbiturates), to make their aggressive, violent behavior more manageable. Even if effective medications are eventually discovered, individuals with ASPD tend to view themselves as OK and not in need of treatment. Compliance with effective treatments is likely to remain a problem. Psychological treatments for ASPD include learning models that emphasize anger control, social skills, and moral reasoning (Frick, Ray, Thornton, & Kahn, 2014). These models appear to be modestly effective in reducing antisocial behavior in children and youth, but they do not appear to have much benefit for individuals who show evidence of true psychopathy, or lack of guilt and empathy (Hornsveld, Nijman, Hollin, & Kraaimaat, 2008). Individuals with ASPD might benefit from training in character formation (Salmon, 2004). Addressing the selfishness inherent in people with ASPD, therapists can attempt to convince the person that doing the right thing will produce more favorable outcomes (e.g., staying out of prison), even if the person fails to grasp the underlying value of respecting the rights of others. Despite these efforts, many nations consider this condition untreatable and rely on incarceration of criminals with ASPD to protect the public. Narcissistic personality disorder (NPD), while potentially disabling, is often accompanied by high overall levels of functioning (Ronningstam, 2014). In addition, many traits associated with this disorder (hypersensitivity, defensiveness, inability to see one’s own role in problems) might reduce the likelihood that a person with it will seek treatment. Finally, lower-functioning individuals with NPD are likely to have other serious psychological problems that motivate them to seek treatment, such as depression, substance abuse, or suicidality, which take precedence over the narcissistic behaviors themselves. As a result, the scientific literature provides fewer details about treating NPD compared to some of the other personality disorders. Therapists generally employ CBT with an emphasis on carefully building an alliance with the client (Kealy, Goodman, Rasmussen, Weideman, & Ogrodniczuk, 2017). Psychotherapy for NPD is likely to be most effective when the therapist is aware of the traits that might interfere with the process, such as defensiveness. Clarifying the difference between pathological and protective behaviors and reviewing situations and experiences that trigger narcissistic reactions can be particularly helpful (Ronningstam, 2014). No medications are currently approved specifically for the treatment of borderline personality disorder, but medications are frequently prescribed. Among the commonly prescribed medications are antidepressants, antipsychotic medications, mood stabilizers (e.g., lithium), antianxiety medications (e.g., benzodiazepines), and anticonvulsants. Because of the potential for self-destructive behavior and serious depression, individuals with borderline personality disorder are occasionally hospitalized for a few days for their own safety. Psychotherapy for borderline personality disorder often takes the form of CBT. In this case, the individual learns to manage stress, emotions, and relationships. In particular, psychotherapists emphasize skills aimed at reducing the individual’s potential for suicidal thinking and behavior. An approach specifically designed for individuals with borderline personality disorder, dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), attempts to address symptoms in the order of their importance: reducing suicidal thoughts, reducing behaviors that interfere with therapy, and finally reducing behaviors that interfere with the quality of life (Linehan, Armstrong, Suarez, Allmon, & Heard, 1991). Outcomes using DBT for borderline personality disorder appear superior to those produced by more conventional treatments with CBT (Linehan et al., 2006). Perhaps after reading about the variations in both the biological and psychological treatments available for specific types of disorders, you will better appreciate why people who want to be therapists spend such a long time in school perfecting their skills and learning about their options. Although some disorders seem to defy the available treatment methods, we do not want to leave you with the impression that therapy is somehow ineffective. Quite the contrary is true. Compared to the state of available therapies as recently as 60 years ago, psychologists and psychiatrists have made great strides in their ability to alleviate the distress of many millions of people. As we learn more about the causal factors underlying these disorders, as we surely will by pursuing integrative approaches, our abilities to help will expand. At the same time, we are making significant progress in our understanding about the prevention of many of these disorders, which we hope will make these problems a thing of the past. The use of DBT for borderline personality disorder has been simplified by the development of a smartphone app, which takes the place of keeping diary cards of emotions, events, and problem behaviors. Treatment based on sound psychological science is the goal not only of those working with individuals who have diagnosed psychological disorders, but also counselors working with people who simply want to improve their relationships and well-being. Decades of careful research has informed the recommendations of John and Julie Gottman (Gottman & Gottman, 2017). Their research method of assessing correlations between physiological arousal and behaviors as couples discuss areas of personal conflict now guides their approach to counseling (see Figure 15.19). These methods have predicted which couples will divorce within 5 years. Research by John and Julie Gottman has identified a number of principles that they believe should guide marriage counseling, which they incorporate into their Sound Relationship House model. The Gottmans are fond of observing couples in states of conflict, which they consider to be normal regardless of the couples’ reported happiness. Most couples get along during the good times—it’s often the tough times that test the quality of the relationship. The Gottmans equip couples with simple measures of heart rate as they discuss areas of conflict. This approach is based on their observations that unhappy couples experience much higher levels of sympathetic arousal than happy couples do during conflict. If the measures get too high, the couple is instructed to take a break in the discussion. The general idea is that you can’t solve problems if your levels of arousal are too high, and continuing conflict under these circumstances is destructive. The first step asks the couple to postpone any efforts at persuasion until each person has clarified his or her position. The focus is on self-disclosure, not attack–defend. A second step involves reprocessing past emotional injuries. Couples are guided through five steps with regard to processing past hurts: feelings they had, subjective realities, triggers, taking responsibility and apologizing, and constructive plans. Finally, in the Gottmans’ lab work, they realized that couples raised the same conflicts at 3-year, 6-year, and 9-year intervals! To integrate this concept with their counseling, they worked with couples to accept each partner’s personality (often the source of long-term conflict) and the ideal solutions imagined by each partner. While not removing the problem, the couples could learn to live with it. The Gottmans’ work in the lab has provided them with unique, scientific tools for helping people build more effective relationships with their partners, and even their children. Observations a few months after a wedding predicted the couple’s happiness with their first-born. Data from the last trimester of pregnancy predicted the frequency of a baby’s laughing, smiling, or crying. A 10-hour seminar over 2 days reversed relationship dissatisfaction in 77% of last-trimester couples, an effect replicated now in 24 countries. It is hard to imagine a better use of psychological science than to intervene positively in the happiness of these couples and their children. In chapter 14, we described cyberbullies as being somewhat different from traditional bullies, in that the traditional bullies evidenced Dark Triad traits (Machiavellianism, narcissicim, and psychopathy), but these traits were not predictive of cyberbullying. Instead, cyberbullies were characterized by higher levels of sadism, or taking pleasure in the pain of others. Prior to 1994, sadistic personality disorder was included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), but it is no longer. As a result, relatively little recent psychological research has focused on this behavior, and the research that does exist focuses on sexual sadism. We can assume that the basic features of sadism have been incorporated into the DSM category of ASPD, yet van Geel et al. (2017) were able to distinguish between psychopathy (closely related to ASPD) and sadism. Sadism is described as having theoretical roots completely divorced from the Dark Triad of personality (Paulhus, Jones, Boyle, Saklofske, & Matthews, 2015, p. 582), yet it also is part of what the authors refer to as social toxic personalities, along with sensational interests and amoralism. The Varieties of Sadistic Tendencies (VAST) measure used by van Geel et al. (2017) to study bullies shows independence from Dark Triad traits in statistical analyses and predicts undergraduates’ willingness to crunch bugs in a machine or apply white noise blasts to innocent victims. The instrument also identifies a person’s willingness to engage in vicarious sadism, which, of course, is relevant to the bystanders of cyberbulling and those who share the content produced by their friends. Because of the relative neglect of the topic of nonsexual sadism in the scientific literature, even less is known about interventions that might prove useful. As noted earlier in this chapter in the section on treating ASPD, this type of problem can be highly resistant to treatment. We might hypothesize that the type of sadism seen in cyberbullies also would be resistant to change. Because personality disorders are not diagnosed until adulthood, it is possible that empathy interventions might be somewhat effective with younger cyberbullies. If empathy cannot be established, it is possible that the behavior can be managed using simple learning principles, as described in Chapter 8. Researchers have looked at the consequences in place for cyberbullying and the cyberbullies’ perception of the likelihood of experiencing those consequences (see Figure 15.20). Many states have passed or updated laws in an effort to combat cyberbullying, and police are becoming more likely to be involved. Surveys of middle school students, however, report that they are more deterred by the threat of punishment from their parents and school than the threat of punishment by police (Patchin & Hinduja, 2016). A total of 75% of a group of middle school students believed that the cyberbullies described in six scenarios would face some type of consequence for their behavior (Pettalia, Levin, & Dickinson, 2013). At the same time, students rated the harm done by cyberbullying as much higher than the likelihood of consequences for the perpetrator. Encouraging students to report incidents of cyberbullying, which they may not because they think that nothing will happen and because they fear retaliation, and publicizing the administration of consequences might help reduce the prevalence of cyberbullying. A more reliable solution, however, would be to undermine whatever gains in social status cyberbullies enjoy that continue to positively reinforce their behavior. Middle school children believe that most traditional bullying and cyberbullying will result in some type of consequence. They are more likely to believe that the school will act in response to traditional bullying than cyberbullying, but that parents are about equally likely to act in either case. The children do not seem to think that police responses are likely, but they see cyberbullying as more likely than traditional bullying to produce a police response.
