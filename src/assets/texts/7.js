export const text = `Axons from the sympathetic nervous system form connections in the gut, contributing to those butterflies we feel at times of excitement. Emotion and motivation, the topics of this chapter, involve neural circuits that often operate below the level of our conscious awareness. We can zoom in to look at these neural circuits, like these sympathetic axons (in blue in the large image on the previous page) forming connections with the gut. We have all had the feeling of butterflies in our stomach when we are excited, and these types of neural pathways are responsible for such feelings. Zooming out, we can examine emotion and motivation in the larger context of the individual using the example of elite athletes at the Olympic Games. The 2016 Rio Games featured 11,544 athletes from 205 countries, a tiny fraction of the millions of people who compete in athletics worldwide. To stand out among these elites takes extreme motivation, not to mention talent and hard work. Many athletes competing at this level have focused on their sport to the exclusion of most other activities since they were in elementary school, yet of the more than 11,000 participants, only 972 (or 8%) went home with a medal. Given the odds of obtaining a medal, you would think that any athlete winning one would be ecstatic, but that is not always the case. As you can see in the photograph of Olympic swimmers on the medal stand, the athletes are showing a range of emotions. Look for a moment at the way the three athletes are holding their flower bouquets. The gold and bronze medalists are holding their bouquets straight up, but the silver medalist is close to dropping his bouquet. His entire demeanor says dejection and disappointment. Why would a silver medalist be disappointed with such an exceptional achievement? To answer this question, we must zoom out even farther from the individual to consider the social context. Psychologists have found that the reactions of these swimmers are quite typical (McGraw, Mellers, & Tetlock, 2005;  Medvec, Madey, & Gilovich, 1995). Silver medalists are more likely to compare themselves to gold medalists, which leads to disappointment, while bronze medalists compare themselves to the fourth-place finishers who do not get a medal, which leads to joy. Emotions are spontaneous, automatic responses to our ongoing perceptions and thoughts. In this chapter, we will explore the mechanisms responsible for our emotions and motivations, beginning with the underlying physical mechanisms and zooming out to look at individual and, ultimately, social influences on these behaviors.Emotion and motivation share the experience of subjective feelings and engage similar processes and structures in the brain. However, psychologists find it useful to distinguish between these two concepts. An emotionemotionA combination of arousal, physical sensations, and subjective feelings that occurs spontaneously in response to environmental stimuli.            emotion        A combination of arousal, physical sensations, and subjective feelings that occurs spontaneously in response to environmental stimuli.             is a brief combination of physical sensations, such as a rapid heartbeat, and conscious, subjective feelings, like feeling afraid, that prepares an individual for action. Emotions are spontaneous, automatic responses to our ongoing perceptions and thoughts. We communicate our emotions to others through behaviors such as facial expression, body language, gestures, and tone of voice. If we are thirsty following a tough workout, we are motivated to seek a drink of water. It is unlikely that a thirsty person would be motivated to find a hamburger instead. Psychologists have debated whether emotions should be viewed as discrete stand-alone states or points on a continuum. The discrete approach views emotional states such as happy, sad, or angry as being like primary colors of red, yellow, or blue, while the continuous view sees emotions like a rainbow, with particular emotions being located closer to some than others and even blending together (Russell, 1980; see Figure 7.1). Like many of the either/or discussions that we encounter in psychology, a compromise might be the best strategy. If we think instead of emotions as being stars, we can imagine a constellation containing clusters of positive emotions such as happiness and pride and another constellation containing clusters of negative emotions such as anger and sadness. Russell (1980) suggested that emotions could be viewed along dimensions of pleasant/unpleasant and high arousal to low arousal instead of as isolated states. This approach to emotion suggests that some emotions are closer together than others. Emotions can be distinguished from moods. A mood is a more general state than an emotion. You can be in a good mood while feeling a variety of specific emotions, such as happiness, pride, or relief. A mood generally lasts longer than a single emotion. For example, when we discuss psychological disorders in Chapter 14, we will see that criteria for depression specify that depressed mood should characterize at least half a day every day for 2 weeks (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013). Because emotions are responses to the ongoing and ever-changing flow of environmental information, it is unlikely that any single emotion would last this long. Many animals are motivated to explore their surroundings even when they have no immediate needs because being familiar with your neighborhood saves time when a need does arise, whether that is food, water, shelter from a storm, or a gas station. Today, many people rely on technology to help them navigate in unfamiliar locations. MotivationMotivationA process that arouses, maintains, and guides behavior toward a goal.            Motivation        A process that arouses, maintains, and guides behavior toward a goal.             is defined as a process that arouses, maintains, and guides behavior toward a goal. For example, we are motivated to seek a drink of water in response to thirst. The process of motivation is accompanied by distinct emotional states. Thirst is generally quite distressing, and taking a drink of water can produce positive emotions like relief and happiness. Emotion and motivation share the ability to arouse an organism and stimulate behavior, but motivation does so more directly and precisely than emotions do. People who feel motivated by thirst are likely to do one thing: seek something to drink. In contrast, experiencing the emotion of sadness stimulates behavior, but that behavior can take many forms. Some people respond to sadness by crying in a room by themselves, while others seek the company of friends.Whether we’re experiencing happiness or sadness, anger or disgust, an emotion combines a physical sensation, such as a rapid heartbeat, and a conscious, subjective feeling, like joy or sadness. Psychologists have asked questions about how the physical sensations and subjective feelings might relate to one another.Several major theories of emotion describe the relationship between the physical responses and subjective feelings experienced during an emotion. In other words, what are the connections between those butterflies in your stomach and the knowledge that you’re feeling afraid? These theories of emotion are similar in many ways to efforts to explain perception in Chapter 5. Some attempt to work from the bottom up (from physical sensation to cognitive appraisal), while others work from the top down (from appraisal to physical sensation). Working independently, William James and Danish physiologist Carl Lange developed similar descriptions of the relationship between physical sensations and subjective feelings in emotion (James, 1890; Lange, 1885/1912). Consequently, the James-Lange theoryJames-Lange theoryA theory of emotion that proposes that physical sensations lead to subjective feelings.            James-Lange theory        A theory of emotion that proposes that physical sensations lead to subjective feelings.             bears the names of both men (see Figure 7.2). Each of these theories of emotion— (a) the James-Lange theory, (b) the Cannon-Bard theory, and (c) the Schachter-Singer two-factor theory—attempts to explain how physical responses and subjective feelings occur when we experience an emotion. James believed that emotions could arise from several sources, including the recall from memory of events that were emotional. However, his greatest interest was in emotions that have a distinct bodily expression (James, 1884/1969, p. 189). At the core of the James-Lange theory is the idea that this type of emotion is the result of a sequence of events. Once the individual perceives a stimulus, such as a grizzly bear, that person experiences a physiological response. This physiological response is subsequently interpreted by the individual, giving rise to a conscious awareness of a subjective feeling. The James-Lange theory assumes that physical states related to each type of feeling (sadness and happiness, for instance) are distinct from one another. The theory also assumes that we are capable of correctly labeling these distinct physical states as separate feelings. As James wrote, We feel sorry because we cry, angry because we strike, afraid because we tremble (1890, p. 1006). James’s statement may seem counterintuitive to you. Shouldn’t a good cry make us feel less sad, not more? Many people also believe that holding anger inside instead of expressing it somehow makes feelings of anger build up and become worse. These common sense notions support the concept of catharsiscatharsisA theory of emotion that views emotion as a reservoir that fills up and spills over; it predicts that expressing an emotion will reduce arousal.            catharsis        A theory of emotion that views emotion as a reservoir that fills up and spills over; it predicts that expressing an emotion will reduce arousal.            . In catharsis, emotions are viewed as filling an emotional reservoir. When the reservoir fills up, the emotion will spill over in an uncontrolled manner. For example, we talk about a buildup of hostility or anger that somehow overflows, producing a more extreme response than is warranted by the situation. Catharsis theorists recommend that we avoid this buildup by regularly expressing our emotions. In other words, it might be better to express some anger regularly than to repress your anger and explode. Catharsis and the implications of the James-Lange theory are contradictory. One suggests that expressing an emotion reduces that feeling, while the other argues that expressing an emotion leads to the subjective feeling. Which is correct? If we are feeling sad, does having a good cry make us feel better or more aware of our sadness?One clue to our dilemma comes from an experiment in which participants were directed to make specific movements of the face (Levenson, Ekman, & Friesen, 1990). For example, they might be instructed to raise their eyebrows and form their mouth into the shape of an O. They were not informed that they were to make any particular facial expression, nor were they allowed to view their face in a mirror. They did, however, report feeling the emotion they had portrayed; you might have experienced a feeling of surprise if you followed the same directions. This result is consistent with the notion that expressing an emotion leads to the subjective feeling, rather than reducing it in ways predicted by catharsis. This experiment also supports the James-Lange approach by suggesting that feedback from the body helps us consciously determine the state of our emotions. Consistent with the James-Lange theory of emotion, the physical expression of an emotion might lead to subjective feelings. Traditional Maori warriors prepared for battle by performing a haka. The New Zealand All Blacks rugby team also uses the haka before a game. The James-Lange theory would predict that these men would feel more aggressive after performing the haka. The catharsis approach is further challenged by the phenomenon of psyching up. Traditional Maori warriors of New Zealand prepared for battle by performing a haka, featuring ritual grimaces, vocalizations, and battle moves. A contemporary rugby team, the New Zealand All Blacks, uses the traditional haka of the players’ homeland to prepare for games. Not only do these performances contribute to the athletes’ physical and emotional preparation for participation in a rather violent sport, but they no doubt intimidate the opposing team as well. One implication of the James-Lange theory is that we might be able to influence our subjective feelings by changing our physical sensations. By appearing to be happy, we might begin to feel happier. Another practical outcome of this approach is the impact of modeling facial expression on empathy. The early back-and-forth imitations of facial expressions by adults and infants may contribute to the capacity to read others’ emotions. When students are asked to determine the emotions expressed in the photos on page 245 during a classroom presentation, it is not uncommon to see some individuals spontaneously copy the facial expression in question to identify it correctly. John Stibbard, son of the owner of the Capilano Suspension Bridge, poses on the bridge with the Olympic torch after completing his leg of the torch run in preparation for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, Canada. We might not be as good at reading our physical states as the James-Lange theory requires us to be. One experiment that challenged our ability to distinguish correctly among the physical states of different emotions was carried out in Capilano Canyon, located in British Columbia (Dutton & Aron, 1974). Capilano Canyon may be crossed at one of two locations. The first crossing involves a 450-foot-long bridge with low handrails, suspended about 230 feet above rocks and rapids. Farther upstream, the canyon may be crossed on a solid wooden bridge that is less frightening. In the study, an attractive female experimenter approached single men crossing one of the two bridges. After completing a short interview, the experimenter gave each man her telephone number, in case he had further questions about the experiment. Not only did the men on the frightening bridge include more sexual content in their interviews, but they were about four times as likely to telephone the female researcher later. Although the study is flawed by a failure to randomly assign men to bridges (bolder men might be both more likely to choose the scary bridge and to telephone a stranger), it stimulated further thinking about the James-Lange theory. The results of this study suggest that its participants were not very good at discriminating the physical sensations associated with fear and sexual arousal. We can assume that the attractiveness of the female would be constant, suggesting that the setting in which she was seen largely accounted for the differences in sexual content in interviews and the likelihood of seeking further contact with her. One might speculate that similar mistakes underlie the popularity of horror films and amusement parks with impossibly high roller coasters as dating activities. Scare your date to death, and he or she may interpret feelings of fear as love. These results suggest that in some circumstances, we might not be as good at interpreting our physical sensations as predicted by the James-Lange theory. Walter Cannon disagreed with the James-Lange theory and proposed his own theory, which was later modified by Philip Bard, resulting in the Cannon-Bard theoryCannon-Bard theoryA theory of emotion featuring the simultaneous and independent occurrence of physical sensations and subjective feelings during an emotional experience.            Cannon-Bard theory        A theory of emotion featuring the simultaneous and independent occurrence of physical sensations and subjective feelings during an emotional experience.             (Bard, 1934;  Cannon, 1927). The James-Lange theory proposes a sequence of events, from physical sensations to subjective feeling, but the Cannon-Bard theory proposes that both factors occur simultaneously and independently. How are these theories different? Let’s assume that you are innocently reading your textbook in your room when a bear walks in the door. According to the James-Lange theory, the sight of the bear would immediately set off physical sensations that you would then cognitively interpret as fear. According to the Cannon-Bard theory, the sight of the bear would immediately and simultaneously trigger a subjective feeling of fear (whoa, there’s a bear in my room) and physical sensations (probably the autonomic nervous system’s fight-or-flight response in this example). Unlike the James-Lange theory, the Cannon-Bard theory does not assume that the experience of a subjective feeling depends on physical sensations. The Cannon-Bard theory fares somewhat better in explaining the Capilano Canyon results. Cannon and Bard would be comfortable with the notion that fear and sexual arousal would produce similar physical sensations and that study participants may simply have erred in their cognitive assessment of the situation. Instead of saying, I’m really scared because I’m on this bridge, the participants would say, I think this interviewer is very attractive. According to this model, a person’s cognitive assessments of an emotional situation work independently of any physical sensations that might occur. Stanley Schachter and Jerome Singer (1962) proposed a two-factor theory of emotion that adds an intermediate step between physical sensations and subjective feelings. Emotional arousal signals us to make a conscious, cognitive appraisal of our circumstances, which then allows us to identify the emotion we’re experiencing. The same physical sensations may lead to several interpretations, based on the way an individual assesses a situation. Returning to our example of the bear entering your room, we can see how the Schachter-Singer two-factor theorySchachter-Singer two-factor theoryA theory of emotion in which general arousal leads to assessment, which in turn leads to subjective feelings.            Schachter-Singer two-factor theory        A theory of emotion in which general arousal leads to assessment, which in turn leads to subjective feelings.             differs from the James-Lange and Cannon-Bard approaches. For Schachter and Singer, the sight of the bear would initiate a general state of arousal. To identify the source of your arousal, you would assess your situation, attribute your arousal to the presence of a bear in your room, and identify your feelings as fear (with considerable accuracy, we would assume). Schachter and Singer (1962) directly tested this approach by injecting volunteers with epinephrine (adrenalin), which causes a high level of arousal. The participants had been told that they were getting an injection of a vitamin and that their vision would be tested as soon as another volunteer arrived to participate in the experiment. The second volunteer was actually an actor employed by the researchers. In half of the trials, the actor behaved in a happy, silly manner; in the other half, he acted angry and stomped out of the room. The results supported a role for cognitive appraisal of the environment in the identification of emotion. Participants who were exposed to the happy actor rated themselves as feeling happy, while participants exposed to the angry actor felt more negative. Importantly, when the participants were accurately informed that they were getting a drug that produced arousal instead of a vitamin, the behavior of the actor did not influence their assessment of the situation. Instead, they attributed their feelings to the drug. Botox, a deactivated form of the same toxin that causes botulism poisoning from spoiled food, helps people with migraine headaches and neurological disorders of movement, but it is also used for cosmetic purposes. Botox reduces wrinkling by paralyzing the small muscles used in facial expressions. The ability of Botox to prevent facial movement provides an interesting test for the James-Lange theory (Neal & Chartrand, 2011). Without feedback from our facial expressions, can we identify our own emotions? Without the ability to imitate the facial expressions of others, can we still identify how they’re feeling?The Question: How would increasing and decreasing the ability to move facial muscles affect participants’ judgments of the emotions of others?In a first experiment, 31 female participants were recruited from cosmetic surgery clinics. Of those participants, 16 had been treated with Botox, and the other 15 had been treated with a dermal filler material, which does not restrict the movement of facial muscles. Participants viewed photographs of eyes and the surrounding area and were asked to choose which of four emotional adjectives (happy, sad, and so on) best fit the expression they saw (see Figure 7.3). In a second experiment, a gel that forced participants to put more effort into their facial movements was placed on the faces of half of a group of 95 participants and on the arms of the other half as a control. Participants completed the same test of identification of emotion as before, along with two control tests: identifying emotion in voices, which is unlikely to be affected by facial expression, and a set of arithmetic questions. Actress Rachel Weisz, star of The Mummy and The Bourne Legacy, is not a fan of Botox. She told an interviewer, Acting is all about expression; why would you want to iron out a frown?Following treatment for wrinkles with either Botox or an injected dermal filler (Restylane), study participants were asked to identify the emotional expression of faces presented on a computer screen. The dermal filler group was significantly better than the Botox group at correctly identifying the emotions. This result suggests that by reducing the ability to imitate another person’s facial expressions, Botox limits a person’s perception of the emotions of other people. Because the participants were voluntarily seeking the Botox or dermal filler treatments, their participation in the experiment did not increase their risk. Their confidentiality must be strictly maintained, and a debriefing about the findings should be available. In Experiment 1, the Botox group performed significantly more poorly on the identification of emotions task than the control group. In Experiment 2, participants with the facial gel performed better than those with the gel on their arms. Both experiments support the idea that feedback from facial expressions of emotion influences the ability to identify emotional states in other people. The participants in the first experiment who used Botox had less facial mobility than the participants who used the dermal filler. The lack of facial mobility caused by Botox interfered with the participants’ ability to accurately assess another person’s facial expression of emotion. In the second experiment, making the muscles work harder to imitate a facial expression by applying a restrictive gel actually improved the participants’ ability to identify the facial expressions of others. These results are quite consistent with the James-Lange theory’s emphasis on feedback from the body as important to the subjective identification of emotion, not just in ourselves but also in other people. These results suggest that an important side effect of Botox might be a reduction in social competence and empathy because of an inability to read the emotions of other people correctly. A later attempt to replicate Schachter and Singer’s study did not succeed (Marshall & Zimbardo, 1979). As we discussed in Chapter 2, a failure to replicate a study casts serious doubts on the results. Nonetheless, Schachter and Singer’s theory has provided considerable insight into how we identify our subjective feelings. Schachter and Singer account easily for the Capilano Canyon bridge study. Once aroused by being on the scary bridge, the male subjects assessed their circumstances and attributed their feelings to sexual attraction. Additional support is provided by research that demonstrates that arousal produced by one emotion can transfer to and intensify a second emotion. People who have just exercised (producing physiological arousal) are more likely to become angry or sexually aroused when exposed to relevant stimuli (Reisenzein, 1983). Each of these classic theories offers important insights into our experience of emotion, yet none definitively resolves our original question regarding the relationship between physical sensations and subjective feelings. The same patterns of physical activity may occur during a variety of emotions, and a single emotion may be associated with a variety of physical states. That mistakes can and do happen is certain. Nonetheless, we seem to manage quite well at interpreting our emotions in most situations. A more contemporary model reconciles the debate regarding the impact of physical sensations on subjective feelings (Cacioppo, Berntson, Klein, & Poehlmann, 1997). The somatovisceral afference model of emotion (SAME)somatovisceral afference model of emotion (SAME)A model of emotion in which a range of physical sensations from precise to general requires varying degrees of cognitive processing prior to subjective feelings            somatovisceral afference model of emotion (SAME)        A model of emotion in which a range of physical sensations from precise to general requires varying degrees of cognitive processing prior to subjective feelings             begins with a recognition that physical responses to a stimulus can range from quite specific to quite general. For example, the physical sensations associated with disgust can be more precise than the physical sensations associated with pride. The initial degree of specificity of the physical response leads to different cognitive processing. A highly specific physical response leads to unambiguous recognition of a subjective feeling. This is the situation that appeared most interesting to James. A bear walks in, you react physically, and you know you’re scared. At the other extreme, instead of specific physical responses, a situation might produce general arousal, which requires significant cognitive processing and evaluation. For example, a valedictorian giving a graduation speech might not understand her arousal until she sees her parents and other members of the audience clapping and realizes the emotion she is feeling is pride. This scenario is closest to that proposed by Schachter and Singer (1962). SAME provides middle ground between the James-Lange and the Schachter and Singer theories. If a physical response is only partially specific, an ambiguous message is sent forward that is clarified by the presence of additional cues or information (see Figure 7.4). The model correctly predicts that emotional responses range from immediate to delayed based on the amount of cognitive processing that is required. Emotions that are associated with a precise set of physical responses, such as fear, occur quickly, but emotions that are associated with more general arousal, such as pride, occur relatively slowly. According to appraisal theory, a person who values wealth and a person who values family might experience different emotions in response to the same event. This ambiguous image (you should find yourself alternating between seeing a young woman and seeing an old woman) can serve as a model for how the mind processes a range of emotional situations, from simple to complex. If we look at a simple image, we need little cognitive assessment to respond appropriately. As images become more complex, we require increasing amounts of cognitive assessment before we respond. Processing the simple emotion of fear is similar to processing an unambiguous image. Processing more complex, ambiguous emotions, like pride, requires more cognitive assessment, just like viewing this ambiguous image does. Contemporary cognitive approaches to emotion place little emphasis on the physical correlates that are featured so prominently in the classic theories. Instead, these approaches emphasize the role of appraisalsappraisalsThe detection and assessment of stimuli that are relevant to personal well-being.            appraisals        The detection and assessment of stimuli that are relevant to personal well-being.            , or the detection and assessment of stimuli with relevance for well-being, in eliciting emotion (Moors, Ellsworth, Scherer, & Frijda, 2013). For example,  Ellsworth (1994) expresses some frustration with the approach taken by James when she says, Bears do not automatically cause us to run or tremble. Instead, the interpretation of the stimulus, the bear in this case, forms the critical starting point for the emotional cascade. Appraisal theory further assumes that interpretation is a continuous process rather than a single decision about a stimulus (Moors et al., 2013). For example, attention may be aroused by some change in the environment. A recognizable emotion has not yet occurred, and if the appraisal of the stimulus determines it to be of no significance, arousal returns to baseline. However, if the stimulus is found to have positive or negative value to the individual making the appraisal (a source of food or a predator, for instance), feelings and physiological responses change yet again. An emphasis on appraisal as a starting point for emotion may help us account for the vast range of emotional reactions that individuals might have to the same event (Moors et al., 2013). One person may view material wealth as essential to happiness, whereas another may view successful relationships with others as a primary goal. These different cognitive patterns should produce different emotional responses to the same event. A letter to an advice columnist described a situation in which a man’s wife had wrecked his expensive antique automobile in a serious accident (Dear Abby, January 14, 2006). Our first person, who values money, is likely to respond with dismay at the loss of the expensive car. Our second person, who values relationships, is likely to be happy that his beloved wife survived the accident in one piece.Emotional behavior is not unique to humans. Charles Darwin (1872) made a careful study of the facial expressions produced by humans and other primates. He concluded that all primates form facial expressions using the same muscles, which in turn led him to state that emotional facial expression must have evolved. Although we are frequently cautioned about anthropomorphism, or the attributing of human qualities to other animals, it is easy to identify with the anger of a mother bear defending her cubs or the fear of a gazelle trying to outrun a cheetah. Darwin discovered that humans and other primates use the same facial muscles to produce emotional expressions, leading him to hypothesize that emotions evolved. Can you figure out what emotion is being expressed by both the chimpanzee and the man? Try imitating the expression and think about how you feel. Still no luck? The emotion being expressed is disappointment. The evolution of a behavior implies that it makes survival more likely. A major advantage provided by emotion is the ability to produce arousal. The word emotion is derived from the Latin word meaning to move. The arousal produced by an emotion stimulates action, which might be lifesaving. According to the classic Yerkes-Dodson lawYerkes-Dodson lawA description of the relationships among task complexity, arousal, and performance            Yerkes-Dodson law        A description of the relationships among task complexity, arousal, and performance            , the ideal amount of arousal interacts with the complexity of a task (Yerkes & Dodson, 1908). For simple tasks, such as outrunning a predator, greater arousal leads to greater performance. For more complex tasks, such as taking a difficult exam, arousal levels that are too high can begin to interfere with performance (see Figure 7.5). We have all had the experience of choking. or performing badly because of too much arousal. In addition to providing general arousal, each emotion is associated with a positive or negative quality or valence, which moves us in the correct direction of either approach or avoidance (Davidson & Irwin, 1999). The negative emotion of disgust tells us to avoid rotting food, and positive feelings of happiness cement our social bonds. The Yerkes-Dodson law predicts that the complexity of a task interacts with an organism’s arousal level to determine the quality of performance. For simple tasks, such as running to escape a predator, greater arousal leads to a relatively steady improvement in performance. For difficult tasks, such as completing an exam, moderate amounts of arousal lead to the best performance, and high arousal can lead to weaker performance. In addition to producing beneficial arousal, emotions enhance survival by providing an important means of communication. Nonverbal forms of communication such as facial expression, calls, and body language were used to provide information to others long before humans began using spoken words (see Figure 7.6). If one person assumes a body posture indicating fear, the emotion ripples through a crowd to its edges in a short amount of time (de Gelder, Snyder, Greve, Gerard, & Hadjikhani, 2004). Human infants communicate a range of needs to their parents before developing the ability to speak. You have no difficulty interpreting the facial expressions, body language, and gestures of a driver behind you who doesn’t approve of your lane-change technique. One of the advantages of emotions is the ability to communicate nonverbally. Even with these simple stick figures, it is easy to interpret how each character feels. An additional and welcome benefit of having emotions is our ability to enjoy the arts. Evidence for a coordinated development of language and emotional communication remains in our contemporary brain, which uses the same pathways for language and for the perception and appreciation of music (Schön et al., 2010). Without the capacity to feel, we would find it difficult to appreciate a Picasso or the moving strains of Yesterday by the Beatles. We wouldn’t enjoy a good cry at the end of Pride and Prejudice or be glued to the edge of our seats while watching Mother! The universal nature of human responses to many poems, pieces of music, and other artistic accomplishments points to shared underlying mechanisms, shaped through our evolutionary past. Shared enjoyment of the arts contributes greatly to social bonding in human societies. When we dance together, sing together, or watch plays and other visual displays of art, shared emotional responses contribute to feelings of community and closeness. Long before infants learn to speak, they can communicate with adults by using facial expressions. We can identify further advantages of emotion by studying people whose emotional lives have been affected by brain damage. In Chapter 4, we reviewed the case of Phineas Gage, whose frontal lobe damage changed him from a responsible, well-liked member of the community to an impulsive, indecisive, and emotionally volatile individual who had difficulty keeping a job. More recently, Antonio  Damasio (1994) described the case of a young man named Eliot, who had frontal lobe surgery to remove a tumor. Like Gage, Eliot maintained his intelligence and other skills after his surgery, with the notable exception of his ability to establish priorities. Damasio hypothesized that emotions provide a bridge to past experiences that can be used to set priorities such as approach and avoidance. In the absence of normal feedback from the body that can be used to identify emotional states (my heart is beating fast, so I must be scared), Eliot can no longer use these past experiences to guide his current decisions.The mind’s priority for processing negative events has been described in earlier chapters. For example, in Chapters 1 and 5, we discussed how we are far more sensitive to bitter tastes because these are often associated with poisons than we are to sweet tastes, which are rarely life threatening. In Chapter 4, we identified several nervous system structures that participate in our emotional lives. Emotional responses combine bottom-up processing, in which lower parts of the nervous system send alerts to the cerebral cortex, with top-down processing, in which cortical executive functions such as attention and appraisal modify the activity of the lower structures. The autonomic nervous system, which controls many activities of our glands and organs, participates in the general arousal associated with emotional states. In particular, activity of the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system is correlated with our fight-or-flight response to perceived danger. The autonomic nervous system is under the immediate control of the hypothalamus, a structure that also plays an important role in most motivated behavior. Researchers have asked whether specific patterns of autonomic activity occur during particular emotional states. In a large meta-analysis, autonomic measures did not reliably predict particular emotional states, such as happiness or sadness (Cacioppo, Berntson, Larsen, Poehlmann, & Ito, 2000). However, the analysis indicated that the autonomic responses associated with negative emotions are stronger than those associated with positive emotions. Fear, with its rapid heartbeat and sweaty palms, provokes a more dramatic set of physical reactions than feelings of happiness. In its direct management role over the autonomic nervous system, the hypothalamus participates in any of the emotional states that also engage that system. Is that the only role for the hypothalamus in emotion? It is clear that stimulating the hypothalamus in animals can elicit many behaviors, including sexual behaviors, eating, drinking, and aggression, but it is unclear whether these artificially induced behaviors are accompanied by the feeling part of an emotion. Renewed interest in the hypothalamus and its role in emotion has resulted from experiments using deep brain stimulation, delivered through surgically implanted electrodes, to relieve various conditions from obesity to depression. During stimulation of the hypothalamus, one patient experienced both the physical and subjective feelings normally associated with a panic attack (see Chapter 14) (Wilent et al., 2010). The physical responses, such as shortness of breath and rapid heartbeat, were not surprising given our knowledge of hypothalamic functions, but the patient’s subjective feelings of overwhelming anxiety were unexpected. Additional research following up on this case study might further illuminate the role of the hypothalamus in emotion. The amygdala identifies emotional stimuli, both positive and negative, and initiates responses to the perception of these stimuli (see Figure 7.7). The amygdala’s role in the identification and classification of emotional stimuli is carried out through its participation in a circuit that includes the frontal lobes of the cortex, the cingulate cortex, and the insulainsulaRegions of cortex located at the junction of the frontal and temporal lobes.            insula        Regions of cortex located at the junction of the frontal and temporal lobes.             (see Figure 7.8). People with amygdala damage, like Patient S. M., do not always use information about people’s eyes to judge their emotions. Eye tracking shows (a) how a healthy control participant scans an emotional image and (b) how a person with amygdala damage might scan the same face. (c) For all emotions studied, Patient S. M. showed fewer eye fixations than normal controls (NC). The amygdala not only detects emotional stimuli, but it also forms a bridge between these stimuli and the appropriate responses. The amygdala initiates responses through its tight connections with the hypothalamus, which in turn affects autonomic, hormonal, and behavioral processes. For example, when the amygdala perceives danger from environmental stimuli, it initiates a hormonal cascade involving the pituitary gland and the adrenal glands that produces an increased release of neurochemicals in the brain, leading to an increase in overall arousal. We will discuss this process in greater detail in Chapter 16. One of the first clues to the importance of the amygdala to emotion resulted from an experiment conducted in 1939 in which researchers removed both temporal lobes, which include the amygdalae, from rhesus monkeys (Klüver & Bucy, 1939). After recovery, the normally hard-to-handle adult rhesus monkeys became tamer, and their emotions were less intense. They allowed themselves to be picked up and stroked, and they appeared to be relatively oblivious to stimuli that normally elicit intense fear, such as snakes. They made fewer fear-related grimaces and vocalizations. We now understand that whenever the amygdala is damaged, animals respond inappropriately to danger. Rats with damaged amygdalae fail to learn to fear a tone or other stimulus that reliably predicts the onset of electric shock (LeDoux, Cicchetti, Xagoraris, & Romanski, 1990). Rhesus monkeys with lesioned amygdalae show less fear of rubber snakes and less restraint around unfamiliar monkeys, a potentially dangerous way of behaving in a species that enforces strict social hierarchies (Emery et al., 2001;  Mason, Capitanio, Machado, Mendoza, & Amaral, 2006). Insight into the role of the amygdala in humans has been provided by case studies in which disease has damaged this structure. Patient S. M. experienced damage to both amygdalae because of a rare disease (Adolphs, Tranel, Damasio, & Damasio, 1994). Although Patient S. M. can recognize the emotions of happiness, sadness, and disgust portrayed in photographs, she has selective difficulty identifying fear correctly. As shown in Figure 7.7, Patient S. M. has particular difficulty using information from the eye region of the face in judging emotion, although when she was instructed to pay attention to eyes, her performance improved (Adolphs et al., 2005). Individuals with autism spectrum disorder, discussed in Chapter 14, share Patient S. M.’s reluctance to make eye contact and difficulty identifying other people’s emotions, especially fear. One of the most consistent biological correlates of autism spectrum disorder is abnormal development of the amygdala (Amaral, Schumann, & Nordahl, 2008). These findings suggest that the amygdala participates in both the active exploration of the social environment and the interpretation of the results of that exploration (Adolphs, 2007). The insula, found in the fold between the junction of the temporal lobes with the frontal and parietal lobes, plays an important role in our subjective experiences, or feelings (Damasio, 2003). Activity toward the back of the insula is associated with many internal sensations, including pain and itch, that can be localized as originating from particular parts of the body. This area is also associated with many of the physical sensations we associate with emotional feelings, including changes in blood pressure, breathlessness, and feelings of butterflies in the stomach. In contrast, activity in the forward areas of the insula is associated with more global feelings, including a particularly strong reaction to disgust (Gasquoine, 2014;  Papagno et al., 2016). The cingulate cortex, shown in Figure 7.9, serves as a major gateway between the amygdala and other subcortical structures and the frontal areas of the cortex. In particular, the cingulate cortex participates in processing the emotional quality of physical pain. The cingulate cortex forms circuits with the frontal cortex, the amygdala, and other subcortical structures involved with emotional processing. The basal ganglia are part of the brain’s voluntary movement systems and help coordinate movement in response to assessments of emotion. The basal ganglia show particularly strong activation that correlates with the emotion of disgust. We often dislike our own photographs even when other people seem to think they look fine. Part of the problem is that we rarely see ourselves the way others do—we usually see ourselves in a mirror, which reverses our emotional expressions. Because our facial expressions are not symmetrical, due to the stronger role of the right hemisphere in emotion, that crooked smile looks wrong when we see it on the opposite side of our face. The anterior cingulate cortex, along with the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, contributes to the more conscious appraisal of threat compared to the less conscious signals arising from the amygdala (Kalisch & Gerlicher, 2014). As we will see in Chapter 14, some individuals are unusually anxious. Worrying and catastrophizing (focusing on the worst possible outcomes) by anxious people involves exaggerated appraisals of threat. Unusually high levels of activation in the anterior cingulate cortex have been observed during episodes of catastrophizing and worry. As we discussed in Chapter 4, the basal ganglia are large, subcortical structures that participate in the generation of voluntary movement. These structures coordinate movements in response to emotional stimuli. Strokes that damage the basal ganglia result in an overall reduction in the experience of emotional intensity (Paradiso, Ostedgaard, Vaidya, Ponto, & Robinson, 2013). The nucleus accumbens, which is part of the basal ganglia, is particularly associated with pleasure and reward. The basal ganglia also show considerable activity in response to facial expressions of disgust (Phan, Wager, Taylor, & Liberzon, 2002). This finding is consistent with clinical observations of people with diseases that damage the basal ganglia, such as Huntington’s disease. These people have particular difficulty recognizing facial expressions of disgust, although their recognition of other major emotional facial expressions appears intact (Hennenlotter et al., 2004). As we observed in Chapter 4, damage to the frontal lobes produces changes in emotional behavior. People with frontal lobe damage often experience a reduction in fear and anxiety, which may contribute to their engagement in impulsive, risky behaviors. They seem unable to experience gut feelings that serve as warnings in threatening situations (Damasio, 1994). Without such warnings, these individuals forge ahead impulsively where others would pause. We do not appear to have happy centers or sad centers in the cerebral cortex. Instead, the experience of different emotions produces different patterns of cortical activation. When people are asked to recall a specific event from their past associated with the emotions of anger, sadness, fear, and happiness, brain imaging scans identify distinct patterns of activity for each emotion (Damasio et al., 2000). However, the same brain regions usually participate in more than one of these states.Humans express emotion with their entire bodies. People who are feeling threatened or scared generally cross their arms and hunch forward. Angry, aggressive people typically lean forward, rise onto the balls of their feet, and raise their shoulders to appear larger and more intimidating. However, humans rely most heavily on the face for expressing emotion. This man has a tumor in his right primary motor cortex that prevents him from voluntarily smiling on the left side of his face when asked to do so, as shown in the photo on the left. In contrast, he can smile spontaneously and naturally in response to a genuine, involuntary emotion, as shown in the photo on the right. These observations support the hypothesis that voluntary and spontaneous emotional expressions are managed by different areas of the brain. The smiles, frowns, and other facial expressions we make are influenced by the way the brain controls the tiny muscles of our faces. These muscles receive input from the motor areas of the cerebral cortex, which control voluntary movement, as well as from subcortical areas, including the basal ganglia. The cortical input allows us to voluntarily smile for the camera. The subcortical input is responsible for more spontaneous expressions of emotion, such as laughing at a funny joke. It is possible to lose one type of input without affecting the other. The young man shown in the photo above has a tumor that affects his right motor cortex. When asked to smile voluntarily, his smile appears quite crooked because of the importance of the cortex in voluntary expression. When he smiles spontaneously to a joke, his smile appears more natural because his subcortical areas can still react normally. People with Parkinson’s disease, which damages the subcortical emotional pathways, show the opposite pattern. They may be unable to smile spontaneously in response to a joke, but they can smile voluntarily when asked to do so. Do we learn how to express emotions, or are these behaviors built in? Darwin (1872) believed that human emotional expression had been shaped through evolution. If he is correct, we would expect humans in all parts of the world to share common means of expression. Some major emotional expressions appear to be universal across cultures (Keltner & Ekman, 2000), although not all researchers agree (Gendron, Roberson, van der Vyver, & Barrett, 2014). The primary colors of emotional expression, including anger, sadness, happiness, fear, disgust, surprise, contempt, and embarrassment, are identified correctly by most people, regardless of the culture in which they live. These photos represent the possibly universal expressions of happiness, anger, surprise, disgust, sadness, and fear. Further support for a view of emotional expression as being innate comes from the predictable developmental course shown by young children. Infants’ social smiles (as opposed to smiles resulting from gas, etc.) emerge near the same age (around 3 months), regardless of whether an infant can see faces or is born blind (Freedman, 1964). Monozygotic (identical) twins are more similar than dizygotic (fraternal) twins in the ages at which they first show fear of strangers. As shown in Figure 7.10, children raised in diverse cultures (African bush, urban Guatemala, rural Guatemala, and Israeli kibbutz) showed similar age-related distress at being separated from their mothers (Kagan, Kearsley, & Zelazo, 1978). Children in diverse cultures show the strongest emotional reactions to separation from their mothers around the same stage in development, suggesting that this emotional behavior has a biological origin. Developmental timelines for emotional behavior are also characteristic of nonhuman primate species. Rhesus monkeys raised in isolation performed typical fear responses when shown pictures of other monkeys engaging in threatening behaviors. The isolated monkeys demonstrated these fear responses at the same stage in development as monkeys raised in normal social conditions (Sackett, 1966). Other researchers point to the universality of words for different emotional states as evidence of emotion’s common biological source. Words for emotions have been found to be quite similar in a sample of 60 of the world’s languages (Hupka, Lenton, & Hutchison, 1999). The exceptions, however, are also intriguing. The Japanese term ijirashi refers to a feeling that occurs when we see another person overcoming an obstacle. No equivalent term exists in English. Despite the possibility of a shared biological basis for emotion, we can observe significant individual differences in emotional expressiveness. When young children are exposed to strong, novel stimuli, such as the odor of alcohol on a swab, some react strongly to the stimuli, while others appear to ignore them. Still others show a moderate response to the stimuli (Kagan, 1997). As we will see in Chapters 11 and 14, children who are highly responsive often develop into cautious, anxious adults. In contrast, children who are relatively oblivious to stimulation may develop into bold, fearless risk takers. If their insensitivity extends to social signals produced by others, this lack of sensitivity to stimuli may lead to antisocial behavior. Psychopaths incarcerated for murder show significantly reduced reactions to slides of pleasant, neutral, and unpleasant situations when compared to typical control participants (Herpertz et al., 2001). Individuals also differ in their ability to regulate emotions (Gross, 1998). Two major strategies are used in emotion regulation: suppression, or inhibiting expression, and cognitive reappraisal, or modifying the meaningfulness of an event (English & John, 2013). David Matsumoto carefully compared thousands of photographs from the 2004 Olympic and Paralympic Games and found that all competitors, sighted or blind, displayed the same expressions in response to winning or losing. These results suggest that, as Darwin suggested, some emotional expressions are innate to the human species. The ability to suppress emotional expression can be learned. For example, medical personnel undergo training that affects their expression of disgust. Most patients would not appreciate a physician or nurse who said oh, gross during an examination. Military personnel learn to maintain their composure when a superior is yelling at them face to face, a skill that may be important when a soldier is captured by enemy forces. Many cultures have display rulesdisplay rulesA cultural norm that specifies when, where, and how a person should express an emotion.            display rules        A cultural norm that specifies when, where, and how a person should express an emotion.            , or norms that specify when, where, and how a person should suppress emotion (see Figure 7.11). The reactions of Japanese and American university students were recorded as they watched emotional movies either alone or with a group of students they did not know (Ekman, Friesen, & Ellsworth, 1972). The Japanese students showed more emotion when alone than when in the group of strangers. In contrast, the American students were about as emotional in either case. If anything, Americans tend to show more emotion when in a group than when alone. Americans made more intense expressions of disgust in response to an odor when in a group than when they were alone (Jancke & Kaufmann, 1994). Despite the strong evolutionary and biological heritage we have for spontaneous emotional expression, we can learn to control our emotional expressions to fit a situation. This Marine recruit is expected to remain calm while his drill instructor applies a correction. This skill is believed to help military personnel maintain composure in highly emotional situations. Although cultures worldwide are fairly similar in their emotional expressiveness, variations occur. Switzerland, with a suppression score of 3.05, shows emotion most freely of all these countries, and Hong Kong, with a suppression score of 4.72, shows the least emotion. Reappraisal as a strategy for regulating emotion involves thinking differently about the stimulus that elicits an emotional response rather than attempting to hold in a response. For example, we might be angry when another driver behaves aggressively, perhaps putting us in danger. To manage our anger through suppression, we might simply use willpower to avoid acting in angry ways ourselves. To manage our anger using reappraisal, we focus instead on the fact that the other driver might be having a tough day and that nobody was actually hurt. People who use the reappraisal strategy more than the suppression strategy experience less depression and higher life satisfaction (Gross, 2013). Psychologist Jerome Kagan described individual differences in emotionality based on children’s responsiveness to the environment, ranging from the cautious child to the bold.Human adults are quite accurate in their ability to read emotions. When research participants watched only 10 seconds of a videotaped interaction between a teacher and an off-camera student, they were able to judge whether the teacher liked the student with considerable accuracy (Babad, Bernieri, & Rosenthal, 1991). We might think we do a good job of hiding our feelings, but the subtleties of emotional expression often give us away. At the same time, our ability to distinguish between genuine and fake expressions, while good, is far from perfect (Ekman, Davidson, & Friesen, 1990;  Frank & Ekman, 1993). Individual differences in the ability to perceive the emotions of ourselves and others do occur. Twin studies demonstrate that individual differences in the ability to read emotional expression are heavily influenced by genetics (Anokhin, Golosheykin, & Heath, 2010). These differences form one of the key aspects of emotional intelligence (Salovey & Mayer, 1990). Emotional intelligence refers to our abilities to perceive, use, understand, and manage emotions. Individual differences in emotional intelligence predict the success of both work and personal relationships. This short questionnaire (Gross & John, 2003) will assess how much you use suppression and reappraisal strategies to regulate emotion. For each item, select a number on a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). I control my emotions by changing the way I think about the situation I’m in. When I want to feel less negative emotion, I change the way I’m thinking about the situation. When I want to feel more positive emotion, I change the way I’m thinking about the situation. When I want to feel more positive emotion (such as joy or amusement), I change what I’m thinking about. When I want to feel less negative emotion (such as sadness or anger), I change what I’m thinking about. When I’m faced with a stressful situation, I make myself think about it in a way that helps me stay calm. I control my emotions by not expressing them. When I am feeling negative emotions, I make sure not to express them. I keep my emotions to myself. When I am feeling positive emotions, I am careful not to express them. Items 1 through 6 indicate your use of reappraisal, and items 7 through 10 indicate your use of suppression. It might surprise you to learn that these scales are independent. In other words, a person who uses the suppression strategy quite a bit is no more or less likely to use reappraisal strategies than a person who rarely uses suppression (Gross & John, 2003). Gross and  John (2003) reported that men are more likely than women and non-European-Americans are more likely than European-Americans to use suppression. You might see evidence for these general findings (or not!) among your classmates. Keep in mind that college students are not a representative sample of the adult public. This chapter asks whether emotional expression is universal for the human species or more influenced by culture and learning. Some aspects of emotional expression do seem to be species-wide, while others are clearly influenced by environmental factors. What types of processes might account for cultural differences in emotional suppression? We noted that Western cultures are more expressive than Eastern cultures, perhaps due to the contrast between individualism and collectivism. However, another factor that might explain variations in display rules is a culture’s history of immigration. In countries such as the United States, which has a long history of people immigrating from many different places, emotional expressivity appears to be higher than in countries with less immigration from fewer sources (Rychlowska et al., 2015). In a relatively unpredictable social situation lacking shared language and norms, somewhat exaggerated emotional expression might help avoid misunderstandings. Rychlowska et al. (2015) also found that cultural heterogeneity was predictive of how people interpreted smiling (see Figure 7.12). Smiling can be interpreted as a means of social bonding or friendliness, or as a sign of dominance. People from cultures with high levels of historical immigration from many places were more likely to endorse the bonding interpretation of smiling, while people from relatively homogeneous cultures rated dominance as the most likely reason to smile. Psychologists have usually interpreted cultural differences in emotional suppression as being the result of a culture’s degree of individualism or collectivism. This explanation might be too simple. The amount of immigration experienced by a culture is related to the proportion of the population that interprets smiling as an attempt to reward or bond as opposed to an attempt to dominate. These results emphasize the importance of considering not just present cultural environments, but also historical influences on culture, when attempting to explain cultural differences in behavior. In addition to providing display rules, cultures influence interpretations of emotional expressions. Japanese and American study participants were asked to correctly identify emotional expressions with varying levels of intensity (Matsumoto, 2002). Individuals from both cultures identified the emotion being expressed with considerable accuracy, even at low levels of intensity. However, intensity was interpreted quite differently by the Japanese and the Americans. When emotional expression occurred at low intensities, Japanese participants assumed that people were feeling more than they were willing to express. In contrast, when emotional expression was highly intense, the American participants assumed that people were exaggerating their feelings. Although fake and genuine smiles look similar, we usually do a good job of distinguishing between them. Which of these smiles do you think is real? Which is fake?A person’s ability to read others’ emotional expressions can be reduced by certain psychological disorders (see Chapter 14). Individuals with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder have normal abilities to process facial features but perform worse than typical controls on tasks requiring them to distinguish among facial expressions (Kohler, Walker, Martin, Healey, & Moberg, 2009). People diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and those with antisocial personality disorder have specific difficulties recognizing expressions of fear (Marsh & Blair, 2008). Even though emotional expression is a major means of communication, our abilities to read emotions are not perfect. Juries are made up of human beings, who detect deception in face-to-face encounters only slightly better than chance (Ekman & O’Sullivan, 1991). Polygraph methods are rejected for use in court because of their poor record of accuracy (Kleinmuntz & Szucko, 1984). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) eventually might improve our ability to detect honesty, and fMRI results are beginning to be admitted to U. S. courts of law (see Figure 7.13) (Langleben & Moriarty, 2013). Some researchers consider fMRI to be superior to the traditional polygraph for detecting deception (Langleben et al., 2016), while others are less convinced (Monteleone et al., 2009). Until better technologies are available, what do psychologists know about lying that can help the legal system identify deception?During a standardized task known as the modified Guilty Knowledge Test, which is used to assess deception, participants’ brains showed significantly different activation when lying compared to when they told the truth. Red areas represent brain regions that are more active when the participant is lying, and blue areas represent brain regions that are more active when the participant is telling the truth. So far, laboratory studies have used small numbers of law-abiding participants rather than real criminals and concrete tasks such as reporting which playing card is being held (e.g., ace of spades). It is unknown whether this technology will advance to the point where results will be admitted in a court of law on a regular basis. Lying is difficult, especially in high-stakes situations featuring high arousal. While aroused, people betray their lying in predictable ways (Ekman, 1996). Inappropriate smiling and nervous laughter might reflect the person’s high arousal. A deceptive person stiffens the upper body, nods the head less frequently, and uses fewer hand gestures than normal. In contrast to the reduced mobility of the upper body, the feet swing. An unwillingness to make eye contact might indicate dishonesty. However, in many cultures, making eye contact is considered impolite, and failure to make eye contact should be interpreted cautiously. Liars experience more cognitive demand than truthful people as they must multitask while assembling their deception (Vrij, 2015). The liar may stumble verbally, adding um and uh while seeking to construct a plausible lie. Liars must manage how credible they appear to others. They may be distracted by their goals for lying, such as preventing embarrassment, avoiding criminal charges, or making money. They must actively suppress the truth to avoid slips. If the interviewer can add to the liar’s cognitive load by requesting continued eye contact and asking unanticipated questions, the liar is more likely to slip. An excellent signal that someone is lying is the use of scripted stories, which are lacking in detail. People telling the truth add 20 to 30% more detail to a story compared to liars (Colwell, Hiscock-Anisman, Memon, Taylor, & Prewett, 2007). Another reliable way to identify lying is to ask people to tell their story backward in time (Fisher & Geiselman, 2010). A person telling the truth can simply move from one event to the next, but constructing a false story backward quickly overwhelms a person’s memory for details. Name of theoryMajor featuresJames-Lange theorySpecific physical sensations lead to an identification of the subjective feeling. Cannon-Bard theoryPhysical sensations and subjective feelings occur simultaneously and independently. Schachter-Singer two-factor theoryGeneral arousal, not specific physical states, leads to an appraisal of our surroundings, which allows us to identify our subjective feelings. SAMEDifferent emotional states produce physical responses ranging from specific to ambiguous. Ambiguous responses require more appraisal than specific responses before a subjective feeling is identified. Appraisal theoryEmotions begin with the detection and assessment of stimuli that are relevant to personal well-being.Animals, including humans, have limited time and resources, and a state of arousal is expensive in terms of the energy it requires. Motivational systems allow an animal to be aroused only when necessary, such as when it needs food, and then reduce arousal following the solution of a problem, such as after a meal. Preventing the waste of precious energy resources provides a significant survival advantage. Motivation also provides the benefit of helping an animal prepare to meet future needs. Most animals are motivated to explore their environments because familiarity with an environment allows them to act more effectively when a need arises. We can think of motivation as a process that maintains homeostasishomeostasisA steady internal balance, or equilibrium.            homeostasis        A steady internal balance, or equilibrium.            , a term introduced by psychologist Walter  Cannon (1932) to describe a steady internal balance or equilibrium. To achieve homeostasis, organisms actively defend certain values known as set points. Under normal circumstances, we carefully regulate such variables as core body temperature, fluid levels, and body weight around set pointsset pointsA value that is defended to maintain homeostasis.            set points        A value that is defended to maintain homeostasis.            . Deviations from these set points stimulate behavior by the organism that is designed to reestablish the original values. You might think about this process as analogous to your home’s temperature control. A set point of air temperature is established using your thermostat. If your home’s temperature drops below that set point, the furnace is activated until the set point is again established. If your home’s temperature rises above the set point, the air-conditioning system is activated until the set point is regained. Similarly, if your core body temperature drops below, your body initiates several processes designed to increase its temperature, such as producing heat by the muscle contractions we know as shivering. If your core body temperature rises above its set point, cooling mechanisms are activated. You sweat, and the evaporating moisture cools your skin. Blood is diverted to the outer parts of the body, leading to a flushed appearance. Motivation begins with a stimulus, arising from either the internal or the external environment of the organism, that serves as a cue for motivated behavior. Stimuli that are important to survival, such as the presence of a predator or a deficit in body fluids, generate arousal and tension, a state frequently called drivedriveA state of tension and arousal triggered by cues important for survival.            drive        A state of tension and arousal triggered by cues important for survival.             (Hull, 1943). Being in a drive state propels the organism into some sort of action related to the stimulus, whether that means running from the predator to safety or pulling a bottle of water from a backpack to quench thirst. If actions are successful in regaining equilibrium, we experience drive reductiondrive reductionThe state of relief and reward produced by removing the tension and arousal of the drive state.            drive reduction        The state of relief and reward produced by removing the tension and arousal of the drive state.            , accompanied by a rewarding feeling of relief. Drive theories of motivation are often described as push theories because drive is seen as pushing an organism toward a goal. However, not all psychologists agree that motivation requires the push of drive. Instead, they suggest that rewards or incentivesincentivesA reward that pulls an organism’s behavior in a particular direction            incentives        A reward that pulls an organism’s behavior in a particular direction             have the capacity to pull an organism in a particular direction. According to this view, animals are viewed as naturally inclined to act on their environment rather than wait passively for a need to arise (Deci & Ryan, 2000). In incentive theories, no reference to unpleasant internal drive states is required to explain motivated behavior. Incentives or rewards may be intrinsic or extrinsic. Intrinsic rewardsIntrinsic rewardsA reward that arises internally.            Intrinsic rewards        A reward that arises internally.             arise internally, such as feelings of accomplishment when a goal is met. Extrinsic rewardsExtrinsic rewardsA reward from an outside source.            Extrinsic rewards        A reward from an outside source.             come from outside sources, such as money for completing work or praise from a supervisor. These different types of reward can interact in complex ways (see Figure 7.14). In some cases, extrinsic rewards can have negative effects on intrinsic motivation. For example, if a child who enjoys reading suddenly gets paid for each book completed, the child’s enjoyment of reading might decrease because the motivation shifts from intrinsic, the love of reading, to extrinsic, the love of reward money (DeCharms, 1968). Harvard University economist Roland Fryer overcame a tough childhood in Daytona, Florida, to become the youngest tenured African American professor in the history of the university. Drawing on his personal experiences, Fryer experimented with different incentives for a variety of school-related behaviors. His results suggest that the relationships among intrinsic rewards, extrinsic rewards, and behavior can be quite complex. Although previous research has shown that extrinsic rewards can undermine intrinsic motivation, it is important to remember that this result occurs only when behavior is intrinsically motivated in the first place. If children do not intrinsically enjoy reading, Fryer suggests paying them to read might work. Unfortunately, Fryer has been the target of death threats for suggesting this simple solution to illiteracy.

No Effect Paying children for higher test scores did not lead to more learning or better grades — or any measureable changes. Psychologists have studied a range of motives, from the mostly physical motives of temperature control and thirst to the more cognitive and social motives to affiliate with others and to achieve. We will explore this range by discussing some specific motives in detail, including hunger, sexuality, affiliation, and achievement. After discussing these examples, we will examine the ways humans set priorities when faced with competing motives. A combination of metrics that varied from school to school but always included attendance and behaviorNot including control groupsHunger is a complex motive. In comparison to the regulation of body temperature through processes such as sweating or shivering, the reduction of hunger through eating is more heavily influenced by emotion, learning, and culture. Humans take in a remarkable variety of nutrients. The traditional diet of the Inuit people living in Arctic regions contains little plant material, whereas vegans adhere to a diet that contains no animal material. Humans consume a range of diets, from the nearly all-meat diet of the traditional Inuit cultures to the vegan diet. We respond to combinations of external and internal cues that make us feel hungry. External cues for hunger include time of day, the sights and smells of favorite foods, admonitions that we should clean our plates, or the social settings in which food is presented. These external cues may encourage us to eat when our bodies do not need nutrients or to eat more food than we require. Individuals who are very responsive to external cues might find maintaining a healthy weight to be somewhat challenging. Internal cues for hunger are generated when our bodies are genuinely short on nutrients. Short on nutrients applies to the maintenance of current, not necessarily ideal, weight. A morbidly obese person is likely to feel as hungry as a thin person when sufficient nutrients are not available to maintain the status quo. Walter Cannon believed that stomach contractions were an important component in the detection of hunger, and to prove his point, he persuaded his colleague A. L. Washburn to swallow a balloon attached to an air pump (Cannon & Washburn, 1912). The balloon allowed Washburn’s stomach contractions to be monitored while Washburn indicated feelings of hunger by pushing a telegraph key (because he couldn’t talk with a tube down his throat). Although Washburn’s key presses correlated with his stomach contractions, these signals do not tell the whole story. People who have had their stomachs surgically removed still experience a sense of hunger in the general region where the stomach used to be. Most of us start eating long before our stomachs begin to growl, indicating that additional types of signaling must be at work (see Figure 7.15). Walter Cannon (1871–1945) and his assistant, A. L. Washburn, performed one of the earliest experiments on the relationship between stomach contractions and feelings of hunger. The large waves at the top were Cannon’s recordings of Washburn’s stomach contractions, and the smaller waves at the bottom represent Washburn’s key taps indicating hunger. Although these two events are correlated, there is more to hunger than a growling stomach. An important hunger cue is a low level of circulating sugars, particularly glucoseglucoseA type of sugar that plays an important role in hunger levels.            glucose        A type of sugar that plays an important role in hunger levels.            . Glucose concentrations in the blood are highest just following a meal. As glucose levels drop over time, a person begins to feel hungry again. Glucose levels are intimately connected with levels of the hormone insulin. Insulin, released by the pancreas, moves circulating glucose from the blood into cells awaiting nutrients. Typically, glucose and insulin levels are positively correlated. Right after a meal, both are high. Glucose levels rise as glucose is extracted from the food that has been consumed, and insulin is high because its release is triggered by the anticipation and consumption of food. As time goes by without more food, glucose moves from the blood into other tissues, and insulin is no longer released, leading to lower levels of both substances in the blood. These lower levels of glucose and insulin should signal the need for more food (see Figure 7.16). Following a meal (time 0), a healthy person experiences a large spike in insulin levels. In contrast, a person with type 2 diabetes has a slower and less dramatic release of insulin. The person with diabetes will not be able to move glucose out of the blood into cells requiring nutrients. The appetite-suppressing action of insulin will be less effective, and the person with diabetes will remain hungry. This is an overly simplistic conclusion, however. High glucose levels occur in poorly managed diabetes because of either a lack of insulin production (type 1 diabetes) or the body’s resistance to insulin (type 2 diabetes). Without sufficient insulin activity, circulating glucose is unable to move out of the blood into the cells that need nutrients. If hunger results from low levels of circulating glucose, we would expect people with untreated diabetes to not feel very hungry, but this is not the case. Most people with diabetes who have high blood sugar report feeling hungry all the time. This makes sense when you consider that their cells are starving because of their inability to obtain glucose from the blood. It is more accurate to say that the amount of glucose that is available to cells is an indicator of hunger (Mayer, 1955). Hunger results whenever cells are unable to obtain the glucose they require. Hunger also occurs in response to low levels of stored fats (Kennedy, 1953). If you maintain a healthy weight, you are carrying sufficient body fat to survive 5 to 6 weeks of total starvation. The heavier the person, the longer that individual can survive without food. One person survived a medically supervised fast of 382 days, during which time his weight dropped from 455.4 pounds (207 kilograms) to 179.5 pounds (81.6 kilograms) (Stewart & Fleming, 1973). The body monitors fat stores by assessing levels of the hormone leptinleptinA hormone secreted by fat cells that helps the body maintain an appropriate level of stored fat.            leptin        A hormone secreted by fat cells that helps the body maintain an appropriate level of stored fat.            . Leptin, from the Greek word leptos, or thin, is produced and secreted by fat cells (Zhang et al., 1994). Because fat stores and leptin levels are positively correlated, leptin levels provide a measure for the amount of fat that has been stored. As shown in Figure 7.17, leptin levels and their associated fat stores initiate a cascade of events that influence eating behavior. When fat stores and leptin levels are low, brain areas that include the lateral hypothalamus (LH) initiate feeding. When the LH is lesioned, rats fail to eat and die of starvation unless force-fed (Anand & Brobeck, 1951). Stimulation of the LH typically initiates immediate eating. Low fat stores and leptin levels also activate the parasympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system, enhancing the body’s ability to digest and store nutrients. Metabolism, or the chemical reactions required by life, slows down, allowing nutrients to be stored rather than used up right away. Activation of the parasympathetic nervous system, initiation of feeding behavior, and reduction in metabolic rate allow the animal to find, eat, and store nutrients. As fat stores return to normal, leptin levels increase, and the feeding cycle tapers off. Unfortunately for the person trying to lose weight, the leptin system does a good job of defending a set point. As the dieter successfully decreases body fat levels, the associated low levels of leptin initiate a feeding cycle. The dieter feels constantly hungry, making the maintenance of weight loss often more difficult than the initial loss. Feeding is stimulated by two additional hormones: ghrelin, which is released by the pancreas and the lining of the stomach (Howard et al., 1996), and orexins, produced in the LH (de Lecea et al., 1998;  Sakurai et al., 1998). Ghrelin release increases with time since the last meal and appears to contribute to the rewarding aspects of feeding. Orexin activity contributes to feeding because it is negatively correlated with blood glucose levels (Cai et al., 1999). Orexins also participate in sleep (see Chapter 6), suggesting that they might link feeding, activity levels, and sleep. People of normal weight carry enough fat to survive 5 to 6 weeks of total starvation, although this is obviously not a good thing to do for one’s health. Baba Ramdev, a yoga guru, was hospitalized after losing 12 pounds by the seventh day of a hunger strike against corruption. It is likely that Ramdev was already quite thin at the beginning of his fast. We reach the point of satietysatietyA sense of feeling full and not requiring further food            satiety        A sense of feeling full and not requiring further food             or fullness long before the nutrients we have eaten can make their way to waiting cells. Just as stomach contractions serve as signals for hunger, an obvious sign of satiety is a feeling of stomach fullness. In extreme cases of obesity, some people choose to have a portion of the stomach stapled or banded to produce this feeling of fullness after less food has been eaten. In the brain, the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) participates in sensing satiety. As shown in Figure 7.18, lesions of the VMH produce a syndrome of large weight gains (Hoebel & Teitelbaum, 1966). Although the VMH plays a significant role in satiety, it is overly simplistic to assume that it works alone and directly. Among the many indirect effects of VMH lesions are boosts in insulin production, which in turn produce low blood glucose levels and hunger. Following lesioning of the VMH, rats nearly tripled their normal weight, suggesting that the VMH plays a significant role in satiety. However, satiety is too complex to be explained as the function of a single part of the brain. Satiety also results from the release of the gut hormone cholecystokinin (CCK) by the digestive system in response to the arrival of food, especially fatty foods. CCK not only acts in the digestive tract but also serves as a chemical messenger in the brain. CCK limits meals by activating pathways that connect the hindbrain to the digestive system (Blevins et al., 2009). Drugs that inhibit CCK’s action in the brain increase eating behavior, further supporting the hypothesis that CCK normally acts to inhibit further eating (Cooper & Dourish, 1990). Earlier we observed the cascade of events initiated by low levels of stored fat and leptin that led to feeding and the storage of nutrients. What happens when fat and leptin levels rise again? With increased storage of fat, leptin levels rise, initiating a sequence of events that inhibit feeding (see Figure 7.19). The sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system is activated, leading to the expenditure of energy, metabolic rate increases, and inhibition of feeding. As time without food progresses, fat and leptin levels drop and the feeding sequence is reinitiated. Because of leptin’s role in satiety, scientists initially believed it might be helpful as a dieting aid. Mice genetically engineered to lack genes that produce leptin become obese. Injections of leptin allow them to lose weight (Halaas et al., 1995). Unfortunately, people do not respond like mice; obese humans have very high circulating leptin levels but appear to become resistant to the satiety messages this state should produce (Friedman & Halaas, 1998). Adding further leptin is unlikely to lead to weight loss. Our ancestors were much more likely to starve than to be troubled by having too much food. Those who lived and reproduced exhibited characteristics best suited for surviving famine. As we will see in the next sections, the same motivational mechanisms that evolved to prevent starvation among hunter-gatherers might not work well in a society featuring cultural influences on body image and an ample and calorie-rich food supply. What do we mean by obesity? A well-respected approach to body weight is the body mass index (BMI)body mass index (BMI)A height-to-weight ratio used to identify healthy weight, underweight, overweight, and obesity            body mass index (BMI)        A height-to-weight ratio used to identify healthy weight, underweight, overweight, and obesity            , shown in Figure 7.20. The BMI is a simple height-to-weight ratio computed by dividing weight in kilograms by the square of height in meters. We have converted Figure 7.20 to inches and pounds for convenience. A BMI score between 18.5 and 24.9 is considered healthy. A BMI score between 25 and 30 is considered overweight, and a BMI score above 30 is considered obese. This system works well for most people, but it does not account for those who have unusually heavy skeletons or musculature. Many elite athletes would score in the overweight or even obese range despite being quite fit. Using a BMI score of 30 or above as a criterion, rates of obesity in the United States tripled from 12% of the adult population in 1991 to 37% in 2014 (Ogden, Carroll, Fryar, & Flegal, 2015). In 1990, no state reported that more than 15% of its adult population was obese, but by 2015, no state reported fewer than 20% of its adult population was obese, and four states reported that over 35% of their adult population was obese (see Figure 7.21). Obesity rose in all age groups. How can we account for this rapid increase in obesity over the last two and a half decades? It is unlikely that current obesity levels are the result of a single cause. Genetic predispositions, lifestyle issues, and social comparisons all make significant contributions to obesity. In 1990, no state reported that more than 15% of its population was obese, and the overall national rate of obesity was 12%. By 2015, no state reported that less than 20% of its adult population was obese, and four states reported that more than 35% of their adult population was obese. Genes can influence factors such as set point and rate of metabolism, and twin studies indicate that some people are more likely than others to become obese (Livshits, Kato, Wilson, & Spector, 2007). Although genes are unlikely to have changed dramatically over a few decades, complex interactions between genes and environmental factors, such as the bisphenol A in plastic products discussed in Chapter 3, could affect current rates of obesity (Dolinoy, Huang, & Jirtle, 2007). Genes might also interact with the bacteria populations in the gut, which differ considerably between obese and lean humans (Million et al., 2013). Manipulations of bacteria through antibiotics and probiotics have been used to promote weight gain in livestock for decades. Transplantation of gut bacteria from obese to lean animals led to obesity (Turnbaugh et al., 2006). The bacteria found in the obese animals appears to be more efficient at harvesting energy from the animal’s diet. Beginning in the 1800s, in an effort to prevent starvation, initiatives leading to increased cheap sources of high-calorie foods were adopted worldwide. Currently, global agriculture produces 2,600 calories per person per day, which is expected to rise to 3,000 calories per person per day by 2030 (Caballero, 2007). With such a plentiful food supply, we can see why obesity is becoming a global problem even as starvation remains a serious concern in many parts of the world. A cultural contribution to obesity is our contemporary, sedentary lifestyle, with many people spending hours sitting in front of televisions or computers. Humans use energy efficiently. At rest, we use only 12 kilocalories (usually described simply as calories) per pound per day. This means that the average 150-pound couch potato needs only about 1,800 calories of food per day. Even the most demanding activities require a remarkably small investment in resources. Cyclists competing in the challenging Tour de France use an average of 5,900 calories per day (Armstrong & Jenkins, 2000). Meals at many chain restaurants contain more than 2,500 calories, the total daily requirement for a person who weighs 208 pounds and has a typical level of activity. To avoid starvation, our ancestors developed strong preferences for calorie-rich foods containing sugars and fats. When food supplies are limited, these preferences ensured that humans would spend the greatest amounts of time and energy seeking these rich sources of calories. Unfortunately, we retain these preferences today and continue to gravitate to sugary, fatty foods. Zooming out from individual factors to the larger social context, we see that social factors also contribute to obesity. We apparently keep track of how we are doing by comparing our size to that of those in our social circles. Having an obese spouse raises your risk of obesity by 37%, and having obese friends raises your risk by 57% (Christakis & Fowler, 2007). The path to a healthy weight can be difficult. Unfortunately, weight loss for our ancestors usually meant they were one step closer to death by starvation, and we are well prepared to prevent that occurrence. Once a person is obese, a new set point is established and subsequently staunchly defended. Even the surgical removal of fat, or liposuction, does not result in permanent weight loss because the fat removed by the process is replaced or redistributed to other parts of the body within one year (Hernandez et al., 2011). The average adult weighing 150 pounds needs only 1,800 calories per day. When a single dessert item such as cheesecake provides about 70% of that daily requirement, it becomes easy to see how people eating out frequently could become overweight or obese. It is also likely that before eating the cheesecake a diner might have an appetizer, salad, entrée, and beverage. This doesn’t include meals and snacks consumed at other times throughout the day. Calorie-reducing diets work, but dietary changes cannot be viewed as something to do until a goal weight is reached. If the dieter returns to previous eating habits, the lost weight is quickly regained. Successful diets should be viewed as lifestyle changes that are sustainable for an individual. For example, removing one sugared soft drink per day should result in about a 10-pound weight loss over the next year. It is essential for the dieter to avoid triggering mechanisms designed to prevent starvation, such as lowering metabolic rates. By keeping activity levels up and restricting weight loss to a pound or two per week at most, it is possible to slide weight loss under the radar of our vigilant weight maintenance systems. Efforts to use chemicals to control weight have been discouraging. During the 1950s and 1960s, it was not uncommon for American doctors to prescribe amphetamines for weight loss. Although amphetamines suppress appetite, their psychoactive and addictive properties make this approach less than desirable. More recently, several new medications have been approved for the treatment of obesity. One, orlistat (Xenical), reduces the absorption of fats by the digestive tract. The remaining approved medications target appetite mechanisms in the hypothalamus or prevent reabsorption of glucose by the kidneys. Medications do not work on their own but instead make it somewhat easier for obese individuals to maintain lifestyles that are more consistent with a healthy weight (Apovian et al., 2015). Contrary to popular opinion, many people lose weight by dieting and are successful in maintaining their weight loss for years. The National Weight Control Registry tracks more than 5,000 case studies of successful maintainers, including Drew Saur. Saur lost more than 150 pounds and has maintained his loss since 2005. He began by counting the calories he was consuming and was astonished to find that he was eating about 5,000 calories per day, not surprising given his starting weight of 325 pounds. By gradually reducing calories and waiting to eat until he felt hungry, Saur lost about 2 to 3 pounds per week. He began walking, and when his weight loss permitted more activity, he switched to running. Successful dieters and maintainers such as Saur do not view dieting as something drastic to do before a wedding or class reunion but as a gradual lifestyle change that is livable. Some individuals who become discouraged with diets and medication turn instead to surgical interventions, including stomach stapling and gastric bypass procedures, which literally reduce the amount of nutrients that can be consumed or processed. While the resulting weight loss can be dramatic (the average gastric bypass patient loses 90 pounds within 3 months of surgery) (Maggard et al., 2005), these procedures represent major surgery and often result in complications. Although it is feasible that current research into brain mechanisms for hunger and satiety may eventually lead to better treatments for obesity, lifestyle changes leading to healthier eating and exercise habits remain the most reliable approach. Coexisting with our ongoing obesity epidemic are eating disorders characterized by unusual patterns of eating and distortions of a person’s body image. Normally, we have an accurate view of what we look like. People with distorted body image can be convinced they are obese when they are in danger of starvation. Traditionally, eating disorders have been viewed as a problem for women and as less typical for men. However, increasing numbers of men are experiencing eating disorders and body dissatisfaction. The lifetime incidence of eating disorders in males is approximately 0.17%, compared to about 3% in females (Pedersen et al., 2014). Rates of eating disorders are about six times higher among homosexual and bisexual men compared to heterosexual men, although sexual orientation does not seem to be associated with additional risks for eating disorders among women (Matthews-Ewald, Zullig, & Ward, 2014). Anorexia nervosaAnorexia nervosaAn eating disorder characterized by the maintenance of unusually low body weight and a distorted body image.            Anorexia nervosa        An eating disorder characterized by the maintenance of unusually low body weight and a distorted body image.             is characterized by the maintenance of unusually low body weight, an intense fear of gaining weight, and a distorted view of the body as obese (APA, 2013). Anorexia literally means loss of appetite. People with anorexia can show two patterns of behavior (APA, 2013). In the restricting type, people simply eat little food. In the bingeing-purging type, people combine restricted eating most of the time with behaviors associated with bulimia nervosa, which we discuss later. Anorexia nervosa is dramatic but rare, affecting about 0.4% of females and perhaps 0.04% of males (APA, 2013). Anorexia nervosa is one of the few psychological disorders that can kill, with up to 5% of people with the disorder dying per decade from causes related to the condition, which includes an elevated risk for suicide (APA, 2013). Other symptoms include interruption of normal menstruation in females, very dry and yellow skin, fine downy hair (lanugo) on the face and other parts of the body, increased sensitivity to cold, and cardiovascular and gastrointestinal problems. Bulimia nervosaBulimia nervosaAn eating disorder characterized by bingeing, purging, and having feelings of depression, disgust, and lost control.            Bulimia nervosa        An eating disorder characterized by bingeing, purging, and having feelings of depression, disgust, and lost control.             is characterized by cycles of binge eating, in which unusually large amounts of food are consumed, and purging through the use of vomiting or laxatives. Bingeing is often followed by feelings of depression, disgust, and a sense of lost control. Bulimia is more common than anorexia, affecting 1.5% of women and between 0.15% and 0.5% of men (APA, 2013;  Hudson, Hiripi, Pope, & Kessler, 2007). Binge-eating disorderBinge-eating disorderAn eating disorder characterized by eating abnormally large amounts of food at one sitting and feeling that eating is out of control, without compensatory behaviors such as induced vomiting or the use of laxatives.            Binge-eating disorder        An eating disorder characterized by eating abnormally large amounts of food at one sitting and feeling that eating is out of control, without compensatory behaviors such as induced vomiting or the use of laxatives.             is similar to bulimia nervosa in regard to eating abnormally large amounts of food at one sitting and feeling that eating is out of control, but it does not include compensatory behaviors such as induced vomiting or the use of laxatives (APA, 2013). People with binge-eating disorder eat rapidly, eat until they are uncomfortably full, eat when they are not hungry, and often eat alone because of embarrassment about the quantities they consume. Compared to other eating disorders, differences between males and females with binge-eating disorder are smaller. Approximately 1.6% of adult females and 0.8% of adult males meet the criteria for this disorder (APA, 2013). We have defined healthy weight as a BMI score between 18.5 and 24.9, yet the typical runway model held up as a cultural standard for beauty has an average BMI score of only 16.5. In response to several deaths of ultrathin models, some European countries now require models to maintain a minimum BMI score of 18.5. The United States has not followed suit, and American designers have complained that this standard would require a 6-foot-tall model to balloon to 136 pounds. In contrast, a 6-foot-tall model with a BMI score of 16.5 would weigh a scant 121 pounds. It is not surprising that young women exposed to these standards of beauty occasionally develop distorted images of their own bodies. Environmental factors, especially cultural attitudes toward beauty, can play a significant role in the development of eating disorders. Anne Becker and her colleagues were observing eating patterns in the Fiji Islands when American television became available in 1995 (Becker, Burwell, Herzog, Hamburg, & Gilman, 2002). Prior to this time, Becker reported that dieting was unknown in this culture, which valued a robust, well-muscled body for both men and women. The Fijian language has a term for going thin that is used to express concern about someone who may be losing weight because of health problems. In the United States, people may say, Have you lost weight? You look great! In Fiji, a person is more likely to say, Are you okay? You look like you’re going thin. These cultural norms underwent nearly overnight change with the introduction of American television, with its frequent images of glamorous, ultrathin actresses. Suddenly, 74% of the adolescent girls in Becker et al.’s study reported themselves as being too big or too fat. Teens began to report dieting with the same frequency as their American counterparts, a radical shift from the researchers’ observations since 1988. Because Becker et al.’s data are correlational, we cannot conclude that watching television produced disordered eating in Fiji. However, the results are suggestive of strong cultural influences on patterns of disordered eating. Freedom of speech is a cherished right, especially in the United States, and we decide to restrict access to data reluctantly, as in the case of movie and video game rating systems. Despite these strong values, many health professionals cringe when viewing so-called pro-ana sites online. Some of these communities are designed to help people with eating disorders, but many are unabashedly in favor of promoting thinness at any cost. One example, thinintentionsforever.com, features tips such as Friends will only get in the way. Avoid them until you reach your goals. Comments on the site include ones like this: I need to lose weight, and fast. I am 11 years of age, and am over 110 pounds. I want to get under 100. I cannot buy laxatives or anything, and my mom is against ana. HELP! The site is one of the first to show up on a Google search for pro-ana sites. What do we know about the influence of these sites? Teens diagnosed with eating disorders visit pro-ana sites regularly, and few of their parents were aware of either the existence of these sites or their teens’ use of the site (Wilson, Peebles, Hardy, & Litt, 2006). Individuals with eating disorders who frequent pro-ana sites show more disturbed body image and eating habits than people who view medical information sites about their disorders (Rodgers, Lowy, Halperin, & Franko, 2016). Further research could discover how the use of these sites influences recovery from eating disorders. In the meantime, raising awareness among parents, peers, and health advisers of the existence and content of these sites might increase our ability to help those who have eating disorders. It is likely that general personality characteristics that increase a person’s risk for eating disorders may be heritable, not the disorders themselves (Farstad, McGeown, & von Ranson, 2016). Evidence from twin studies has been mixed, with some authors reporting heritability of 48 to 88% for eating disorders and others finding no evidence of genetic influences (Hinney & Volckmar, 2013). People might have a genetic vulnerability to disordered eating in general but not toward a specific type of eating disorder (Bulik, Kleiman, & Yilmaz, 2016). Once an eating disorder is established, biological factors contribute to maintaining abnormal patterns of eating. Even after people with anorexia nervosa regain normal weight, some still show evidence of elevated levels of hormones that typically raise metabolism and inhibit feeding (Stanley et al., 2003). The binge-purge cycling of bulimia involves processes similar to those of addiction (Avena, Rada, & Hoebel, 2008). When food-deprived rats are given access to sugar water, they tend to binge by consuming larger than normal amounts. Subsequently, if the bingeing rats are given naloxone, a chemical that blocks the action of opioid drugs (discussed in Chapter 6), they respond as if they had been addicted to opioids. People who fast and then binge on sweets may set up a similar addictive process that is difficult to stop. A questionnaire known as the Yale Food Addiction Scale 2.0 shows that nearly all individuals with bulimia act as though they have a food addiction (Vries & Meule, 2016). Before the introduction of American television programming to the islands of Fiji in 1995, the cultural ideal for both men and women was a robust, well-muscled body, as evidenced by this traditional dancer. Dieting and eating disorders were unknown. A short time after American television was available, however, Fijian rates of dieting and eating disorders grew to match American rates and ideal beauties became slimmer. Treating anorexia nervosa can be challenging because the therapist is facing a person who is terrified of gaining weight. The first priority is keeping the person alive, and this effort typically involves hospitalization and careful monitoring of food intake. Cognitive behavioral therapy may be used to address distortions of body image (see Chapter 15), but no known medications are effective in treating anorexia (Dold, Aigner, Klabunde, Treasure, & Kasper, 2015). About 50% of people with anorexia make a full recovery, but nearly 20% fail to respond. Treating bulimia and binge-eating disorder is somewhat more encouraging. Antidepressant medications, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are usually quite effective, especially when combined with cognitive behavioral treatment (Johnson, Tsoh, & Vanrado, 1996;  Kass, Kolko, & Wilfley, 2013).Although sexual behavior is essential for the survival of a species, unlike eating, it is not essential to the survival of an individual organism. However, individuals’ sexual behavior appears to be maintained by processes similar to the life-sustaining motivations we have already discussed. Sexuality is an extremely complex aspect of human behavior. In this chapter, we will focus on the more physical aspects of sexual motivation. In Chapter 11, we will explore sexuality across the life span, and in Chapter 13, we will discuss phenomena related to attraction and maintaining relationships. The females of most mammalian species undergo estrus, a period of hours or days during which the female is receptive or willing to have sex. In these species, hormone levels and sexual behavior are tightly linked. In humans and Old World primates, menstrual cycles replace periods of estrus. The sexual behavior of estrus and nonestrus species is quite different (Rushton et al., 2001). Human females show receptivity throughout the menstrual cycle. However, women who are not using chemical contraception report feeling more interest in sex around the time of ovulation (Cappelletti & Wallen, 2016). This situation has obvious advantages for the reproduction of the species because this is when sexual behavior is most likely to lead to pregnancy. Traditionally, female sexual interest has been viewed as correlated with levels of testosteronetestosteroneA male hormone.            testosterone        A male hormone.            . Women typically produce about one-tenth the amount of testosterone that men produce. Women’s adrenal glands produce up to half of their circulating androgens or male hormones, including testosterone, with the ovaries producing the rest (Abraham, 1974). An early influential study found that women who have had their adrenal glands removed decreased their sexual activity (Waxenberg, Drellich, & Sutherland, 1959). This led to decades of research and treatment that assumed that adrenal hormones, and testosterone in particular, were important to female sexual desire. However, more contemporary research points to the sex hormones released by the ovaries as being responsible for female sexual desire. The relative contributions of testosterone and estradiol, the major female sex hormone, remain the subject of considerable debate (Cappelletti & Wallen, 2016). Testosterone is clearly correlated with sexual interest in males. However, as long as a man’s testosterone falls within a normal range, it does not provide a strong predictor of an individual’s sexual frequency (Gray et al., 2005;  Mazur & Booth, 1998). Below-normal levels of testosterone, as in castration, are usually accompanied by very low sexual desire and activity. Male testosterone levels fluctuate over the course of a day and are influenced not only by a man’s biology but also by several environmental factors, notably situations perceived as competitive. Male collegiate athletes experience increases in testosterone in anticipation of upcoming competitive events. Following a competition, testosterone continues to rise among the winners and temporarily decreases among the losers (Booth, Shelley, Mazur, Tharp, & Kittok, 1989). Simply observing a competition may influence testosterone levels. Men cheering for the successful Brazilian soccer team at the 1994 World Cup experienced increased testosterone levels, whereas men supporting the losing Italian team experienced a decrease (Bernhardt, Dabbs, Fielden, & Lutter, 1998). These fluctuations are more dramatic when taking the location of the venue into account. Losing at home produces a more dramatic decrease in testosterone than losing a game as the visiting team. This response to losing a competition at home may represent a remnant of our ancestors’ need to defend their territory. We can assume that losing a battle is catastrophic in any circumstance, but losing near your family and home makes them especially vulnerable to destruction. Male testosterone levels are also influenced by relationship status. Men in stable, long-term relationships have lower testosterone levels than single men or men who are within a few years of divorce (Mazur & Michalek, 1998). Men’s testosterone levels also drop significantly after the birth of a child (Gettler, McDade, Feranil, & Kuzawa, 2011). These changes might reflect a feedback loop in which reproductive success signals a decrease in testosterone (Puts et al., 2015). High testosterone levels interfere with pair-bonding and parental care by stimulating continued competition for mates and also have costs related to immune system functioning. It makes sense that the achievement of reproductive goals would lead to a reduction in the competitive behaviors and physical costs associated with high testosterone levels (see Figure 7.22). In males, higher testosterone levels are associated with psychological factors including increased competitiveness and sexual desire, which then lead to increased sexual behavior. As reproductive goals (e.g., mating and producing children) are achieved, male testosterone levels drop again. High testosterone levels are not compatible with pair-bonding and parenting and have detrimental effects on the immune system, so this decrease represents an effective adaptation. We have seen how sexual desire is correlated with testosterone for men and testosterone and estradiol for women, but romantic love is associated with two other hormones, oxytocin and vasopressin (see Figure 7.23). In humans, both hormones are active in the brain, but vasopressin is expressed more by males, and oxytocin is expressed more by females (Ishunina & Swaab, 1999; van Londen et al., 1997). In both sexes, oxytocin enhances bonding. Women release oxytocin during breastfeeding and even respond to a brief hug from their partners with a spike in oxytocin release (Light, Grewen, & Amico, 2005). Oxytocin is released at orgasm in both sexes. However, because of the greater overall expression of oxytocin in the brains of females, along with the 10 times higher testosterone levels in men, it appears that women are more likely than men to equate sexual desire with feelings of romantic love (Diamond, 2004). We do not mean to imply that men do not bond, but high testosterone levels are likely to make sexual activity highly salient for young men, with or without the bonding associated with oxytocin release. The discovery of the importance of oxytocin and vasopressin to bonding originated in the study of two types of rodents: the prairie vole and the montane vole. Although similar in many ways, the two types of vole differed in both their bonding to a partner and their parenting behaviors. Prairie voles are monogamous for life, but montane voles are not. Prairie voles share parenting duties, but montane voles do not. Differences between the two types of vole in oxytocin and vasopressin were closely associated with the behavioral differences, with the prairie voles showing higher levels of both hormones than the montane voles. In one type of study, voles are allowed to mate, and then they are placed in a test box. On either side of the male, who can move freely, are two females—a stranger and the partner—who are tethered in their boxes and can’t move. The chart shows how much time the average male prairie vole and montane vole spend with the partner, with the stranger, or alone. As you can see, the prairie voles prefer to be with their partners, but the montane voles prefer to be alone. Although cultural values often link sexual desire and romantic love, these two functions represent distinct biological and emotional states. Romantic love promotes the establishment of long-term relationships, whereas sexual desire promotes mating (Cacioppo, 2016). Both romantic love and sexual desire involve the insula. Sexual desire is correlated with activity toward the rear of the insula, consistent with other observations that the back of the brain is more involved with current and short-term sensory experiences. In contrast, romantic love is associated with activity toward the front of the insula, consistent with future-thinking about more abstract concepts (Cacioppo & Cacioppo, 2013). Romantic love and sexual desire often occur along a time continuum, with the pleasant sensorimotor experiences associated with sexual desire leading to the more cognitive feelings of romantic love (Cacioppo, Bianchi-Demicheli,  Frum, Pfaus, & Lewis, 2012). A study of a rare patient with a lesion in the insula suggests that activity in the insula does not simply correlate with romantic love and sexual desire but actually contributes to differences between these processes (Cacioppo et al., 2013). Humans show wide variations in sexual and emotional satisfaction within relationships (see Figure 7.24). Cross-cultural studies show that subjective sexual satisfaction depends on a number of factors, including relative equality between men and women, mental and physical health, and the importance of sexual behavior for an individual (Laumann et al., 2006). In the United States, more committed relationships produce the highest levels of both sexual and emotional satisfaction (Mark, Garcia, & Fisher, 2015). Individuals who expect to continue a relationship are more attentive to their partners, both emotionally and sexually. In contrast, one-night stands receive the lowest sexual and emotional satisfaction scores from participants and promote the strongest feelings of regret (Fisher, Worth, Garcia, & Meredith, 2012). A survey of nearly 30,000 people in 29 countries showed wide variations in sexual satisfaction. In most countries, there was a strong correlation between relational satisfaction (defined as a combination of physical pleasure with a partner and emotional satisfaction with a partner) and sexual satisfaction. Gender differences in satisfaction with sexual function were the smallest in Cluster 1 countries. Historically, research on sexual satisfaction has focused on heterosexual couples. Relatively few studies have considered sexual satisfaction across sexual orientations. Mark and her colleagues (2015) found no differences in sexual and emotional satisfaction among heterosexual, bisexual, and homosexual individuals in committed relationships but did observe differences in casual sexual contexts. Individuals of all sexual orientations reported more emotional and sexual satisfaction from committed relationships than from casual sex situations. However, gay and bisexual men reported experiencing higher amounts of sexual and emotional satisfaction from casual sex contexts than heterosexual individuals, while lesbian women reported less, although the size of these differences was relatively small. A homosexual orientation is carefully defined as a stable pattern of attraction to people of the same gender. Homosexual behavior can occur with or without a homosexual orientation. Among the Sambian people of New Guinea, young males are separated from their mothers and expected to engage in homosexual behavior with older males. The Sambian people believe that obtaining semen in this manner transforms them into powerful warriors (Herdt, 1987). After marriage, the now-adult man is no longer expected to engage in homosexual behavior. Individual differences in human sexuality are substantial and normal. One of the ways individuals vary is in their sexual orientationsexual orientationA stable pattern of attraction to members of a particular sex.            sexual orientation        A stable pattern of attraction to members of a particular sex.            , which refers to a stable pattern of attraction to members of a particular sex. A person’s sexual orientation can incorporate behavior, attraction, and identity (Ward, Dahlhamer, Galinsky, & Joestl, 2014). These three components are often congruent, but not necessarily so. Many people engage in same-sex behavior and fantasy while maintaining a strong heterosexual orientation. In the Sambia tribal culture of New Guinea, all adolescent males are expected to engage in same-sex behavior before marrying women (Stoller & Herdt, 1985). The adult sexual orientation of these men remained overwhelmingly heterosexual. The U. S. National Health Interview Survey incorporated carefully crafted questions about sexual orientation beginning with Which of the following best represents how you think about yourself? Choices for males included gay, straight (that is, not gay), bisexual, something else, and I don’t know the answer. Choices for females included lesbian or gay, straight (that is, not lesbian or gay), bisexual, something else, and I don’t know the answer. Individuals who chose something else or I don’t know the answer were asked follow-up questions but were not included in the overall report of the data. Results showed that 97.7% of women and 97.8% of men identified themselves as straight, 1.5% of women and 1.8% of men identified themselves as homosexual, and 0.9% of women and 0.4% of men identified themselves as bisexual (Ward, Dahlhamer, Galinsky, & Joestl, 2014). It is likely that male and female sexual orientations emerge along different pathways (Diamond, 2012). Sexual orientation in males tends to be stable, acting like a compass, whereas females experience more fluidity in their sexual attractions over time. Women are more likely than men to experience physical arousal and desire for both sexes and to report changes in their degree of same-sex or other-sex attraction over time (Diamond, 2012). Genes appear to influence sexual orientation, although the exact mechanisms with which they do so are not well understood and are likely to be quite complex. Like most human behaviors, sexual orientation is probably the result of an interaction between genetic factors and other aspects of the individual’s experience, which can include prenatal factors. To assess the genetic contribution to sexual orientation, researchers have compared rates of homosexuality in twins. If one identical male twin is homosexual, his twin has about a 50% chance of also being homosexual (Kirk, Bailey, & Martin, 2000). Analyses of twin reports of the number of lifetime same-sex partners showed that sexual orientation is somewhat heritable for both males (0.34–0.39) and females (0.18–0.19) (Långström, Rahman, Carlström, & Lichtenstein, 2010). Genome-wide linkage scans compare complete sets of DNA for individuals that differ in a trait. This type of study shows that male sexual orientation is associated with chromosome 8 and an area of the X chromosome known as xq28 (Sanders et al., 2015). As genetic methods continue to improve, it is likely that we will have a better understanding of the role of genes in sexual orientation in the future. Among the other possible biological variables affecting sexual orientation are levels of prenatal, but not adult, sex hormones. Women with a condition known as congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) experience high prenatal levels of male hormones. Consequently, they are often born with masculinized external genitalia, are more likely to describe themselves as tomboys, and are more likely to engage in lesbian or bisexual behavior (Meyer-Bahlburg, Dolezal, Baker, & New, 2008). However, most women with CAH are heterosexual, just as most lesbian and bisexual women do not have a history of CAH or similar conditions. An interesting clue to the origin of sexual orientation arises from the observation that birth order influences the odds that a man is homosexual. Men who have older brothers from the same mother are more likely to be gay than men who have no siblings, younger siblings only, or older sisters (Balthazart, 2011;  Blanchard, 1997). Theoretically, carrying a male fetus could provoke a mother’s immune response, which would become stronger with each successive male fetus she carries. Her immune response could influence the development of her fetus by altering significant hormonal processes. Several structures in the brain are known to be different in males and females and also seem to differ between homosexual and heterosexual males. Among these is a small cluster of neurons located in the hypothalamus known as the interstitial nucleus of the anterior hypothalamus (INAH; see Figure 7.25). There are four separate nuclei in INAH. Two of these, INAH-2 and INAH-3, are notably larger in males than in females (Allen, Hines, Shryne, & Gorski, 1989). The exact function of these nuclei in humans is unknown, although animal research suggests that they participate in sexual behavior. Building on this research about differences between the brains of men and women, Simon LeVay asked whether INAH-3 might be different in heterosexual and homosexual males. After examining the brains of more than 40 individuals, LeVay (1991) concluded that INAH-3 in homosexual men was about two to three times smaller than in heterosexual men, or about the same size as typically found in women. Simon LeVay reported that an area of the hypothalamus known as INAH-3 differs between heterosexual and homosexual men. If you compare the samples in (b) and (c), you can see that INAH-3, indicated by the four dark arrows, appears to be larger in the heterosexual male sample than in the homosexual male sample. The impact of this size difference on adult sexual behavior or sexual orientation remains unknown, however, because these are correlational data. LeVay was quite cautious in his interpretation of his results. The homosexual individuals in his sample had all died from AIDS. Otherwise, there would be little reason to note sexual orientation on a person’s medical records. Although it is unlikely that AIDS would produce this type of change in the brain, LeVay could not rule out that possibility based on his data. LeVay also raised the possibility that engaging in homosexual behavior might influence INAH-3, even in the adult, although he gave little credence to that possibility. Nonetheless, LeVay’s research had a profound effect on the way psychologists and the public looked at sexual orientation. Before the 1990s, the medical and psychological research literatures used the term sexual preference instead of today’s sexual orientation. Because of the difficulties arising from this type of research in humans, others have investigated the correlations between brain structure and sexual behavior in animals. Among domestic sheep, 6 to 8% of rams (males) mate exclusively with other males. The sheep equivalent of INAH-3 is about the same size in ewes (females) as in the rams that mated with other rams. This structure is larger in rams that mated with ewes (Roselli, Larkin, Resko, Stellflug, & Stormshak, 2004).So far, our discussion has focused on motivational behavior that is central to maintaining life. In addition, humans experience a range of complex cognitive and social motives. A lengthy list of these types of complex motives published in 1938 included achievement, affiliation, autonomy, nurturance, dominance, play, and order (Murray, 1938). More recent work focuses on needs for competence and relatedness (Deci & Ryan, 2000). Although some psychologists retain strong distinctions between biological and psychological motives, the dividing line is surely blurred. When an individual’s need for affiliation is not met, the consequences of the resulting loneliness include biological factors, such as increased rates of illness and death (Cacioppo et al., 2015). Humans are a social species. Our need to belong might not seem to be in the same category to you as our need for nutrients and sexual behavior, but the results of many studies show that affiliation works similarly to the other motivations we have discussed so far (Baumeister & Leary, 1995). When people are asked to identify which pleasures are most important to their happiness, the overwhelming majority rate love, intimacy, and social affiliationaffiliationBeing associated with other people.            affiliation        Being associated with other people.             above wealth, fame, and even physical health (Cacioppo & Patrick, 2008). Not only do people value affiliation, but a perceived lack of connection with others can have devastating effects. Solitary confinement is viewed as one of the worst punishments humans inflict on one another. The effects of social isolation can be as detrimental to good health as high blood pressure, lack of exercise, obesity, or smoking (House, Landis, & Umberson, 1988). Not all behaviors associated with feeling isolated are self-destructive. In some cases, feeling isolated can result in outwardly hostile behavior (see Figure 7.26). Students told in an experiment that a personality test had shown that they were the type likely to end up alone later in life showed less empathy and more aggression toward other students than did students told that they would enjoy rewarding relationships throughout life (Twenge, Baumeister, Tice, & Stucke, 2001). It is probably not an accident that most individuals responsible for mass shootings are described as outcasts or loners. People who were told that a personality test indicated they were likely to spend their future alone without significant relationships were far less helpful across different types of tasks than participants who were told that they were likely to have a future featuring acceptance and belongingness. The experience of loneliness appears to serve as an aversive signal that, like hunger, thirst, and pain, evolved to warn humans that they are facing a threat to their survival and that their social connections are in need of repair (Cacioppo & Patrick, 2008). Social connections are especially important to the survival of humans. Compared to other species, humans require the greatest amount of parenting to survive to adulthood and reproduce. In addition, as we discuss in Chapter 13, humans are not well equipped to survive in isolation. Our ancestors formed hunter-gatherer groups because the cooperative sharing of responsibilities enhanced the survival of all group members. Individuals differ in the amount of social connection they desire. Early work on affiliation by Henry  Murray (1938) and David  McClelland (1985) viewed the need for others as similar to a personality trait, as we discuss further in Chapter 12. Some people are relatively happy working in a cubicle for hours on end, while this lack of social contact would be intolerable for others. Still others might feel lonely even when surrounded by large numbers of caring friends and family members. We appear to have a set point for social activity that operates similarly to the set points we mentioned in our discussion of hunger. When we sense a gap between our actual social connectivity and what we desire, we experience the unpleasant state of loneliness, which in turn motivates us to seek more social experiences. Twin studies show that this set point, like the others we have discussed, is influenced by our genetics (Boomsma, Willemsen, Dolan, Hawkley, & Cacioppo, 2005). Knowing one identical twin’s need for affiliation helps predict the other twin’s need. Individual predispositions interact with people’s situations to predict desire for affiliation. We frequently join others to share good events, whether that means a birthday, a wedding, a promotion, or simply the end of another round of final exams. We have all enjoyed the camaraderie of staying in the stands long after our team has won an important game, celebrating with nearby fans and exchanging high fives. People affiliate not only to share happy occasions, such as the introduction of a royal baby, but also to reduce stress in sad times, such as when family members of victims of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks gathered to throw flowers in the memorial pools at Ground Zero. Affiliation is not just for good times, however. People often find that the company of others helps to reduce stress. In a classic series of experiments, Stanley  Schachter (1959) showed that people expecting to be given a painful electric shock were more likely to seek the company of other study participants than to wait for their shock alone. Not all stressful situations are equally likely to produce affiliation, however. In one study, participants were told that they would be performing embarrassing behaviors, such as sucking on large pacifiers (Sarnoff & Zimbardo, 1961). These participants made different choices than the participants expecting shock in the previous study: They preferred to be alone. Exactly what does the company of other people contribute to reducing stress? It appears that we appreciate the company of others when we expect them to reduce our stress. In many cases, other people can reduce our stress by providing information. Hospital patients awaiting dangerous surgeries preferred roommates who had already been through the procedure to those who had not yet had surgery (Kulik, Mahler, & Moore, 1996). Achievement motivationAchievement motivationA desire to excel or outperform others            Achievement motivation        A desire to excel or outperform others            , or the desire to excel or outperform others, has been a topic of interest to psychologists beginning with William  James (1890). Using measures of individual achievement motivation, people who are high in achievement motivation have been shown to seek and typically succeed in competitive, entrepreneurial occupations (McClelland, 1985). The role of individual achievement motivation in predicting performance has been of great interest in the fields of education, management, and athletics. Many psychologists have recognized that individual differences in achievement motivation seem similar to personality traits, which we discuss in Chapter 12 (Elliot & Murayama, 2008). A trait is a stable characteristic that shows relatively little variation over time. However, traits also typically interact with situations. An introverted person might seem more introverted at a big party than when out to dinner with one friend. According to this more complex view, a person’s trait achievement motivation interacts with the opportunities present in the environment (Hart & Albarracin, 2009). For example, achieving excellence might be viewed as an alternative to having fun or enjoying leisure time. High-achieving people do not dislike fun but are prepared to avoid or postpone some fun to meet their achievement goals. Low-achieving people may be perfectly capable of success but, for a variety of reasons, have simply prioritized fun alternatives and inhibited the achievement alternatives. A person’s trait level of achievement motivation interacts with the opportunities to achieve available in the environment. Carol  Dweck (2012) argues that achievement motivation is influenced by people’s beliefs about their own abilities. Individuals with a growth mindset, or a belief that capacities can be developed, outperform individuals with a fixed mindset, or a belief that capacities do not change. In other words, a person with a fixed mindset might say I’m not good at math, while a person with a growth mindset might say math is hard, but I’m getting better at it. Individuals with a fixed mindset avoid challenges, become defensive when criticized, and feel envious when they see someone performing better. In contrast, individuals with a growth mindset focus on the processes that lead to success, such as hard work and trying out new strategies. Instead of catastrophes, mistakes are viewed as important sources of information eventually leading to a solution. A number of practical implications emerge from the study of achievement motivation. Many teachers, managers, and coaches emphasize competition, such as sales contests, as a way to promote achievement. While this competitive approach works well for people who are high in achievement motivation, it might not work so well for those who are lower in this trait (Hart & Albarracin, 2009). For lower achievers, messages that emphasize the fun and relaxing aspects of a task might be more likely to elicit the best outcomes. Dweck cautions that her work is often misinterpreted by teachers and parents, who claim everyone is smart or praise children for working hard even when they’re not making any progress. She advises that praising strategies and tying those to the outcome of the child’s efforts is more effective (You tried different things and figured out the solution).We have discussed several different motivations, from hunger to sex to affiliation to achievement. If faced simultaneously with many drives and demands, how do we decide which motivations to follow first?As we observed in the case of achievement motivation, situations often present us with multiple, overlapping opportunities and goals (Elliot, 1999). Approach and avoidance differ in valence or natural attractiveness, with approach involving positive and desirable outcomes and avoidance involving negative and undesirable outcomes. A particular situation might stimulate us to engage in a behavior to approach an outcome, avoid one, or possibly do both simultaneously. When you think about your motivation for studying this textbook right now, you might think you are working to get a good grade in the course (approach), avoid getting a poor grade (avoidance), or do some combination of the two. In any case, you are motivated to study. This example is only one of several forms conflicts among motives can take. In the example mentioned previously of the student facing a choice between doing well in school and enjoying fun and leisure time, the conflict occurs between two positive choices, or approach-approach. The individual must decide which goal has priority. In still other cases, choices occur between two unpleasant alternatives (avoidance-avoidance). If you don’t stay late at work, your boss will think you’re a lazy employee, but if you do stay late at work, your partner will be angry. In most real-world situations, choices typically have multiple, overlapping approach-avoidance aspects, making the prioritization of goals essential. An early effort to provide a model for prioritizing motives was contributed by Abraham Maslow in 1943. Maslow viewed motivation as a hierarchy of needs, in which lower levels must be satisfied before the individual can pursue higher-level needs. As shown in Figure 7.27, Maslow’s model is typically illustrated as a pyramid. Maslow’s classic pyramid depicting his hierarchy of needs is shown in (a).  Kenrick et al. (2010) have proposed an updated version of the pyramid (b) that incorporates developmental and evolutionary perspectives. Schoolteachers often face students who come to school hungry or sick because of poverty or neglect. According to Maslow, it is difficult for teachers to interest these children, whose basic needs are unmet, in learning about long division and other subjects. At the lowest level of the pyramid, we find physiological needs, including food, water, and shelter. These basic needs must be met daily; otherwise, life will be threatened. Consequently, if meeting these needs is a challenge for a person, Maslow predicted that the person will not pursue needs at higher levels of the hierarchy. In one classic study, young healthy men were given approximately 1,500 calories per day for 6 months, which resulted in a loss of about 25% of their normal body weight (Keys, Brozek, Henschel, Mickelsen, & Taylor, 1950). Not only did the men become obsessed with food, but their interest in sex declined dramatically. Once physiological needs are met, Maslow suggests that we turn our attention to safety and then to belongingness, represented by the love and affection of others. For Maslow, these three lower categories are essential to human life. Unfortunately, we don’t need to look too far in the daily news to read about large numbers of the world’s population who do not attain these basic needs. Miller (1944) shocked rats while they were eating a food reward they had earned by running down a maze alley, setting up a conflict between approach and avoidance toward the food box. Subsequently, the rat would run down the alley but stop without entering the food box. Miller could adjust where the rats stopped (a point of equilibrium between approach and avoidance) by changing either the rats’ hunger levels or the intensity of the shock. Freed from the challenges of meeting basic needs, we begin to seek esteem, or the respect we receive from other members of the community. At the pinnacle of human striving, however, is the goal of self-actualizationself-actualizationA state of having fulfilled your potential            self-actualization        A state of having fulfilled your potential            . People seeking self-actualization desire to fully meet their potential, as suggested by the U. S. Army slogan Be all you can be. Cultures differ dramatically in their emphasis on self-actualization, with individualistic nations like the United States embracing this value more than collectivist nations in Southeast Asia, where harmony and belongingness are highly valued (Hofstede, 1984). Abraham Maslow did not believe that everyone achieves self-actualization. Among the select few he believed had reached this pinnacle of motivation were Abraham Lincoln and Mahatma Gandhi—as well as U. S. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, shown in this photograph with Madame Chiang Kai-shek. Maslow’s self-actualized people shared common attributes, including independence and a good sense of humor. Who would you add to this list of self-actualized people?Maslow’s classic theory received a recent modification that retained the overall hierarchical organization but added three new perspectives: the evolutionary functions of motives, the development of motives over the life span, and the cognitive priorities assigned to motives in response to environmental stimuli (Kenrick, Griskevicius, Neuberg, & Schaller, 2010). This modified pyramid, illustrated in Figure 7.15, replaces self-actualization with mate acquisition, mate retention, and parenting. The authors of the revision noted that self-actualization was interesting, but they could not find an evolutionary explanation for why we would seek to reach this level. Many of the activities described by Maslow as helping people to reach self-actualization, such as art and poetry, might be better explained as efforts to gain status, which in turn would attract mates. The idea that good relationships are characterized by positive emotions and that bad relationships feature many negative emotions sounds obvious. However, it is unrealistic to think that happy couples never experience conflict. They do, but the way they fight can have a big influence on the likelihood that they will stay together. John Gottman uses a combination of heart rate, facial expression, and analysis of the way people talk about their relationships to each other and to others to make accurate predictions about whether a relationship will last (Gottman, 2011). A key observation is the ratio of positive to negative comments in a couple’s discussion of a problem. Happy couples make five times more positive comments about each other and their relationship during these discussions (e.g., we laugh a lot versus we never have fun). In several places in this textbook, we have emphasized how the human mind is skewed toward the negative, such as noticing bitter tastes over sweet. This slant suggests that it is easy to focus on your partner’s negative qualities, leading to negative emotions and conflict. If we put our relationships on evolutionary cruise control, the ratio of positive-to-negative comments might drop to a point where the relationship is in danger. Maintaining a positive outlook on your partner requires attention and work. Try observing how people talk about their partners, or watch your own behavior, if you’re brave enough. Are you achieving Gottman’s 5:1 ratio of positive to negative comments?Research by John Gottman shows that happy couples do experience negative emotions with each other. However, for every negative incident, they tend to experience five times as many positive emotional interactions. What motivates someone to cyberbully another person? Answers to this question might emerge from what we know about the motivations of face-to-face bullies. Bullying is aggressive, which means that it involves the deliberate intent to harm another. Aggression takes many forms, but bullying research focuses on two types: reactive and proactive aggression (Crick & Dodge, 1996). Reactive aggression involves retaliation for a perceived harm, whereas proactive aggression occurs without provocation and is usually goal-oriented. The goals might be dominating another person or enhancing one’s own reputation or popularity among peers. Research on face-to-face bullying shows that proactive aggression is the norm (Camodeca, Goossens, Terwogt, & Schuengel, 2002). Will this finding also be characteristic of cyberbullying?In cyberbullying, reactive aggression might take the form of retaliation for behaviors or online content that is viewed as insulting. This process can lead quickly to an escalating flame war. Proactive aggression might take the form of hijacking a person’s identity or setting up a fake social media account used to harm the person. Although relatively little research has been done in this area, existing studies point to reactive motivation as the most common form of aggression in cyberbullying (Shapka & Law, 2013). In this sense, then, cyberbullying is not similar to its face-to-face counterpart. Interventions aimed at reducing proactive aggression in cyberbullying, based on similar interventions for face-to-face bullying, might not produce the desired effects. Research has shown that most cyberbullying involves reactive rather than proactive aggression. Here we see that a simple statement from an EPSN publicist provokes a critical reaction from a college football coach. In response, the ESPN publicist fires back with an emotional response.
