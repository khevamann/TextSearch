An interactome among genes implicated in ASD with other cellular proteins confirmed links between ASD and several related conditions and identified new genes that warranted further study.Of all the reasons to study Psychology, Finding ways to improve the lives of people with psychological disorders might be one of the most rewarding. This process begins with understanding the features and possible causes of a disorder.Identifying the causes of psychological disorders requires us to pull together multiple threads leading from the genetic, biological, cognitive, developmental, and social aspects of being human. These causal factors interact with one another in complex ways, so the same disorder might look one way in one individual and quite different in another. We do not know what causes children to develop the symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), discussed in detail later in this chapter, but at least we know where to start looking.We have cautioned you on several occasions in this textbook to avoid the idea that we have genes for this trait or the next because the reality is more complex. As we zoom in to analyze the genetic contributions to ASD, you will see that we have zoomed way past the traditional array of 46 human chromosomes featured in Chapter 3. Instead, we are looking at a visual representation of something that biologists call an interactome—a map of all interactions among proteins in a cell. In this particular case, the researchers were attempting to identify the relationships among the 539 proteins that formed interactions with proteins produced by 26 genes already implicated in ASD (Sakai et al., 2011). The resulting map not only confirmed links between ASD and several related conditions, but also identified genetic relationships that warranted further study.A self-portrait by one of the authors’ (LF) daughters, who has ASD.We refer to people with autism spectrum disorder instead of autistic person because people are so much more than their disorders. Many individuals with ASD, including author LF’s daughter, enjoy varied interests, including art. The pig races at the local Mid-State Fair have been a favorite source of inspiration.What does an interactome mean for a person with autism? Unfortunately, understanding more about the sources of ASD has not yet led to improved treatments. As mentioned in Chapters 8 and 15, the only effective treatment for ASD today is the use of behavioral therapies. Still, such discoveries have the potential to improve the lives of individuals with ASD down the road or to provide information that eventually will help us prevent further cases.To fully understand the experience of individuals with ASD requires us to zoom out to consider overall development. Psychologists point out that we say a person with autism spectrum disorder instead of an autistic person for good reason. People are not their disorders, and much is happening in each individual’s life that has nothing to do with ASD. We could consider the impact of parents, whose age might have been a risk factor for a child’s ASD, or study their ability to manage their child’s behavior. Zooming even further out, we can investigate the effects of ASD on the social connectedness children with ASD experience as they venture out into the world.In this chapter, you will discover a number of types of psychological disorders, each with a unique history and set of characteristics. The next chapter, Chapter 15, will explore the treatments and therapies that psychologists have developed to address the challenges to well-being posed by these disorders.

Mental health experts define a psychological disorder as a syndrome characterized by clinically significant disturbance in an individual’s cognition, emotion regulation, or behavior that reflects a dysfunction in the psychological, biological, or development processes underlying mental functioning (APA, 2013, p. 20). But what does this definition actually mean?Many behaviors considered abnormal are quite similar to normal behaviors. We all know what it feels like to be depressed, but how is that different from having a major depressive disorder? This chapter will help you understand the distinctions, but because those distinctions can be subtle, we also caution you against first-year medical student’s disease, or the sense that you have all the disorders that you are studying.The study of psychological disorders is called abnormal psychologyabnormal psychologyThe study of psychological disorders.

. It is surprisingly difficult, but necessary, for psychologists to agree on the differences between typical and abnormal behaviors because deciding that an individual’s behaviors and mental processes are abnormal is the first step toward labeling that person with a psychological disorder and providing treatment (see Figure 14.1).Psychological disorders can be understood both categorically, which means that each has its own set of distinct characteristics used for diagnosis, and as part of a continuum from normal behavior to severely disordered behavior. The diagnostic criteria discussed in this chapter guide psychologists in their identification of the types and severity of disorders their patients and clients might have.NORMALMILDMODERATEPSYCHOLOGICAL DISORDER—LESS SEVEREPSYCHOLOGICAL DISORDER—MORE SEVEREGood alertness and positive emotional state.Feeling sad or down temporarily, but not for long.Feeling sad, but a strong positive experience such as a good grade could lift mood.Intense sadness most of the day with some trouble concentrating and some loss of appetite.Extreme sadness all of the time with great trouble concentrating and complete loss of appetite.I’m not getting the grades I want this semester, but I’ll keep trying to do my best.I’m struggling at school this semester.

Avoiding contact with professors and classmates.Skipping most classes and unable to maintain eye contact with other people. Strong lack of motivation.Unable to get out of bed, eat, or leave the house. Lack of energy and frequent crying.We can start with the literal meaning of the word abnormal. In Latin, the prefix ab means away from and norma means the rule. In other words, abnormal behavior is literally behavior that is not typical, usual, or regular. This meaning implies a statistical definition of abnormality. By this definition, behaviors that most people do are normal, whereas behaviors that characterize a minority of people are abnormal.This statistical approach has the advantage of being clear (see Figure 14.2). For example, intellectual disability is one of the categories in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, a handbook for diagnosis that we discuss in more detail later in the chapter. The diagnosis of intellectual disability relies heavily on statistics. A score of 70 or below on a standard IQ test is the typical cutoff for identifying an individual with intellectual disability (APA, 2013). Even in this relatively clear situation, however, the statistical approach represents merely a starting point. A diagnosis of intellectual disability also requires an individual to demonstrate difficulties with adaptive skills, which include factors such as communication, self-care, safety, and use of community resources.The word abnormal literally means away from the rule. Both intellectually gifted individuals, usually defined as having an IQ over 130, and individuals with intellectual disability, usually defined as having an IQ below 70, are equally abnormal in this statistical sense of the word. Academy Award–winning producer Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, Django Unchained, and The Hateful Eight) has a reported IQ of 160. Although neither he nor his films are typical, we are unlikely to refer to Tarantino as abnormal. Statistics alone do not capture what we mean by abnormal behavior.A purely statistical approach has several major drawbacks. First, it implies a cultural specificity that we would like to avoid. Because most members of one culture may behave in ways different from those of people in another, the purely statistical approach to abnormality might result in different definitions of psychological disorder from one culture to the next. Second, a statistical definition fails to capture the distress that often accompanies a psychological disorder, both for the person experiencing the disorder and for those interacting with that person.Our tolerance for people engaging in acts that are harmful to themselves is variable. For example, most states in the United States have prohibitions against committing suicide (the irony in prosecuting under such laws appears to have been lost on the legislators).To address these concerns, we might suggest that abnormal behavior deviates from some ideal manner of behaving. This approach succeeds in capturing the general distress that most of us experience when observing or experiencing abnormal behavior. Unfortunately, this approach does nothing to avoid cross-cultural differences in defining disordered behavior. Different cultures are often characterized by diverse ideals. In Western nations, hearing voices that others cannot hear is generally considered abnormal. In other cultures, hearing voices may be viewed more positively, as a sign of religious giftedness (Al-Issa, 1977;  Kurihara, Kato, Sakamoto, Reverger, & Kitamura, 2000). More troublesome is the simple fact that it is difficult, if not impossible, to reach consensus regarding what constitutes ideal behavior. People, including experts in psychology, have deeply divided value judgments regarding sexual conduct, recreational drug use, and a host of other activities.A simple modification of this deviation from the ideal approach can help us to achieve some consensus. Behaviors that cause harm to others are viewed as less than ideal. Unless the person is acting defensively, most of us would agree that such behavior is negative and undesirable. We are also sympathetic to those who have conditions that cause harm to themselves.We don’t know how many people have psychological disorders. A person can be diagnosed with comorbidcomorbidTwo or more disorders in the same individual.

 disorders, which means more than one disorder occurs at the same time, so simply adding up the rates for each type of disorder is not a solution. Statistics can look different for different time frames. The estimate of the number of people who experience a psychological disorder during the previous year is around 26% (Kessler, Chiu, Demler, & Walters, 2005), but estimates of the number of people experiencing a disorder as least once during their lifetime can be much higher. In one longitudinal study of individuals from age 19–20 to age 50, the cumulative probability of experiencing at least one disorder was 73.9% (Angst et al., 2016). These numbers certainly challenge our conceptions of abnormal behavior as unusual.Defining abnormal behavior as a deviation from what is considered ideal immediately runs into problems of cultural specificity. Behaviors like hearing voices that others cannot hear might be considered less than ideal in Western cultures but a gift in others. The ability to hear voices was considered an advantage for shamans, like the one represented transforming into his jaguar spirit companion in this Costa Rican piece from 1000–1500 CE.We can combine the best aspects of each of these approaches to construct a formal definition of abnormal behavior: Abnormal behavior is distressing and harmful to self or others.Although college students have the same rate of psychological disorders as their age peers who are not attending college, as shown in Figure 14.3, the rate of psychological disorders in young adults is higher than in the general population and appear to be increasing (Hunt & Eisenberg, 2010). Nearly half of the young adults under the age of 24 who were surveyed met criteria for at least one psychological disorder in the previous year, including 18% for a personality disorder, 12% for an anxiety disorder, and 11% for either major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder (Blanco et al., 2008). Each of these categories is discussed in more detail in this chapter.Based on face-to-face interviews, college students and their same-age peers who do not attend college have a high rate (nearly 50%) of meeting the criteria for at least one psychological disorder over the past 12 months. College students and age peers not in college did not differ significantly in their rates of psychological disorder, with the exception of alcohol-use disorders, which were higher among those attending college.

The first official effort in the United States to gather data on psychological disorders was the recording of a single category, idiocy/insanity, in the 1840 census (APA, 2000).When you visit your physician or student health center complaining of a sore throat, your health care provider notes your symptoms, compares them to known categories of illness, swabs your throat for a sample, and then determines your diagnosis: You have strep throat. Based on that diagnosis, you are given a prescription for an antibiotic. Unlike medical illnesses, however, psychological disorders are diagnosed purely on the basis of observable behaviors. There are no blood tests, scans, or other medical diagnostic procedures that can be used to determine whether a person has a psychological disorder.To promote consistency in the diagnosis of psychological disorders, mental health professionals typically refer to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)A system for classification of psychological disorders published by the American Psychiatric Association.

, first published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) in 1952. The current, fifth edition is known as DSM-5 (APA, 2013). A second classification system in wide use is the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th edition (ICD-10), which was published by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 1992. An updated 11th edition is due to be published in 2018 (WHO, 2017). Professionals responsible for the DSM and ICD-10 classification systems have coordinated their efforts to reduce the differences between the two systems (APA, 2013).The DSM is not without its critics. Beginning with DSM-III in 1980, some normal behaviors seem to have been categorized as abnormal by the system. Allen Frances, a psychiatrist who chaired the task force in charge of writing the DSM-IV (published in 1994), expressed concern that the committee’s well-meaning efforts had led to three false epidemics—attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, and childhood bipolar disorder—and that the DSM-5 was even worse (Frances, 2010). For example, the DSM-5 lists the following (very normal) behavior as a criterion for ADHD:often avoids, dislikes, or is reluctant to engage in tasks that require sustained mental effort (e.g. schoolwork or homework; for older adolescents and adults, preparing reports, completing forms, reviewing lengthy papers). (APA, 2013, p. 59)The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) has undergone a number of revisions since its first edition in 1952. Over its history, the DSM has become less Freudian and more sensitive to cross-cultural issues. The DSM is published by the American Psychiatric Association.Despite its flaws, the DSM remains the most frequently used tool in the United States for the diagnosis of psychological disorders. Our discussion of types of psychological disorders, therefore, is grounded in the DSM system.

We have seen many examples in this textbook of behaviors that are best understood when viewed from multiple perspectives. The study of psychological disorders provides yet another example of how an integration of multiple perspectives can be useful. This is particularly the case when considering the possible causes for abnormal behaviors.What might an integrated approach to psychological disorder look like? First, we propose that the various perspectives discussed in this textbook (biological, clinical, developmental, cognitive, and social/personality) all have a great deal to say about disorders, but each has more to say about some disorders than about others. By considering the contributions of factors from multiple perspectives, we should have a greater appreciation of the complex interactions that occur among perspectives.Philippe Pinel (1745–1826) is often called the father of modern psychiatry. After observing the more humane treatment of inmates by a former patient turned employee named Jean-Baptiste Pussin at Bicêtre Hospital outside Paris, Pinel followed Pussin’s example by removing the patients’ iron shackles. Instead of the usual treatments of the day—bleeding, purging, and blistering—Pinel made a practice of conversing with the patients regularly.In addition, an integrated perspective helps us understand the reciprocal relationships among factors leading to psychological disorders. Just as a person who is diagnosed with depression might show low levels of serotonin activity in the brain, being in a leadership position boosts a person’s serotonin levels. A simple biological explanation suggesting that chemical imbalances lead to depression, or a simple psychological explanation stating that people who feel powerless are more likely to be depressed, misses the nuances of these reciprocal relationships. The richer understanding of the causal factors leading to a psychological disorder pays off in the development of more effective treatments. Single-perspective thinking usually leads to single-perspective treatments. If you believe that depression is purely the result of chemical imbalances of the brain, then a simple prescription should do the trick. If you believe that hearing voices that others can’t hear is the result of childhood communication patterns, you will miss the opportunity to provide medication that can effectively end these troubling symptoms. Inclusive models describing the entire range of causal factors are more likely to result in effective treatments tailored to the needs of individuals.

Many disorders might have roots in childhood but are more typically diagnosed in adolescence and adulthood. The DSM-5 uses the term neurodevelopmental disorders to refer to disorders that instead are diagnosed typically in childhood, yet often continue throughout the life span (APA, 2013). Two of these neurodevelopmental disorders are examined in this section: ASD and ADHD.

The word autism literally means within oneself. In 1943, psychiatrist Leo Kanner worked with a group of children who shared problems in social communication and interaction and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. Kanner’s observations form the basis of our current diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorderautism spectrum disorderA disorder characterized by deficits in social relatedness and communication skills that are often accompanied by repetitive, ritualistic behavior.

 (ASD; APA, 2013), which combines previous categories of autism and Asperger’s syndrome. ASD represents a spectrum because the severity of the observed deficits can vary widely from individual to individual. Adjustment can range from relatively normal, allowing independent living, to intellectual disability, requiring living with parents or in institutional settings.Rates of ASD have been increasing rapidly over the last two decades (see Figure 14.4). Approximately 1 child out of every 68 has ASD, with rates for boys (1 in 42) significantly higher than rates for girls (1 in 189) (Christensen, 2016). Whether the rates are actually increasing or diagnostic criteria and awareness are changing remains unknown. In the United States, individuals can receive a medical diagnosis using the DSM-5 or be educationally verified by teams of school personnel (Ramsey, Kelly-Vance, Allen, Rosol, & Yoerger, 2016). These different methods of assessment produce different numbers, with higher rates of diagnosis in the educational than in the medical/psychological setting.Rates of ASD continue to increase, but the reasons for this change remain a source of debate in the scientific community. It is possible that the rates are truly increasing, but greater awareness by parents and health care providers, relaxed applications of the diagnostic criteria, and improved availability of services might also be contributing to the observed change.Problems with social relatedness are at the core of this disorder, regardless of the individual’s level of intelligence and adjustment. Beginning in infancy, most children with ASD do not make eye contact or take pleasure in reciprocal games like peekaboo. Insight into the thoughts and points of view of others is particularly lacking. As discussed in Chapter 11, children develop a theory of mind by the time they are 3–4 years of age. Many researchers believe that a failure to develop a normal theory of mind is responsible for many of the social deficits observed in ASD (Baron-Cohen, 1991;  Senju, Southgate, White, & Frith, 2009). Language skills of individuals with ASD can vary widely, from having no language abilities to delayed acquisition of language to normal skills (Ellis Weismer, Lord, & Esler, 2010). Even when language skills are relatively normal, though, individuals with ASD usually experience difficulty maintaining conversations with others because of their social skills deficits.Individuals with ASD often object strenuously to changes in their environments and show a high level of repetitive, routine behavior. Rituals may include repetitive movements, such as rocking, hand flapping, head banging, and twirling. Other individuals may engage in extremely limited preoccupations, such as learning all models of cars ever made by Ford. One possible source of this ritualistic behavior is a general dysfunction in sensory networks. Most individuals with ASD show unusually increased or decreased sensitivity to stimuli (Lane, Young, Baker, & Angley, 2010). They may be relatively insensitive to pain or cold but distressed by normal sound levels (see Figure 14.5). Ritualistic behavior may control or override these disparate sensations.Children with ASD often show differences from healthy children in their sensitivity to environmental stimuli. This graph shows the percentage of children with ASD whose scores on an instrument measuring sensitivity were the same as those of typical children, mildly different from those of typical children (between one and two standard deviations from the mean), and rare compared to those of typical children (more than two standard deviations from the mean). The domains measured included sensitivity to touch (tactile), sensitivity to taste and smell, sensitivity to movement (e.g., fear of falling), underresponsiveness (e.g., touches people), auditory filtering (e.g., fails to respond to name when called), low energy (e.g., tires easily), and visual or auditory (e.g., responds negatively to loud noises or bright lights).Although the causes of ASD remain somewhat mysterious and probably show variable patterns from case to case, scientists are making progress in their understanding. Family and twin studies provide strong evidence that ASD is influenced by genetics (Frazier et al., 2014). The concordance rate for ASD between identical twins may be 76% to 88%, and possibly more (Ronald & Hoekstra, 2011), which means that if one twin has ASD, the other twin has between a 76% and an 88% chance of also having ASD. Hundreds of genes are probably involved, and research attention is focusing on the expression of these genes during brain development (Sakai et al., 2011;  Vorstman et al., 2017). Autopsies of the brains of people with ASD and people with no history of psychological disorder show dramatic differences (Voineagu et al., 2011). In the typical control brains, 174 genes were expressed differently in the frontal lobes than in the temporal lobes, but in the brains of people with ASD, no gene showed evidence of being expressed differently in these two areas.Abnormalities in cortical development might lead to unusual minicolumns, vertical arrays of neurons perpendicular to the surface of the cerebral cortex that represent the smallest processing units of the brain. Individuals with ASD have narrower minicolumns containing normal numbers of cells, but spaced farther apart than those found in healthy individuals. These structural differences are consistent with a pattern of connectivity that favors detailed focus, which could produce the unusual interests and hobbies of people with ASD, over more global processing, like understanding the social environment (Opris & Casanova, 2014).Narrow minicolumns similar to those found in the brains of people with ASD were observed in the brains of three distinguished scientists, none of whom had ASD symptoms, who donated their brains for scientific study. These similarities suggest that the minicolumn structure might account for the extreme focus of interests typical in ASD (Casanova, Switala, Trippe, & Fitzgerald, 2007). Outstanding scientists, like people with autism, have been known to study minute details for long periods of time.Additional structural abnormalities in cases of ASD have been observed in the amygdala, hippocampus, and cerebellum (Barnea-Goraly et al., 2014;  Stoodley, 2014). Researchers continue to debate a possible role in ASD for the mirror system, which has been implicated in empathy, imitation, and language (see Chapter 8).Environmental factors probably interact with genetic factors associated with ASD during sensitive periods of brain development (Engel & Daniels, 2011). Parental age is also a risk factor, with older parents more likely than younger parents to give birth to a child with ASD (Grether, Anderson, Croen, Smith, & Windham, 2009; Shelton, Tancredi, & Hertz-Picciotto, 2010), although the effect is rather small. Prenatal exposure to infection and nutritional factors increase the risk for ASD (Hamlyn, Duhig, McGrath, & Scott, 2013). Use of common antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) during pregnancy is associated with a higher risk for producing a child with ASD (Boukhris, Sheehy, Mottron, & Bérard, 2016; Harrington, Lee, Crum, Zimmerman, & Hertz-Picciotto, 2014).One of the unfortunate consequences of the uncertainty surrounding the causes of ASD has been the vulnerability of concerned parents seeking answers. In a paper later retracted by the British medical journal Lancet, unsubstantiated claims that the routine measles, mumps, and rubella vaccination caused ASD were published. Similar controversies ensued in the United States about thimerosal, a mercury-containing preservative used in some vaccines.Minicolumns in the cerebral cortex function like the microprocessors in modern computers by serving as the basic unit that receives input, processes it, and responds. Individuals with ASD (lower image) have smaller minicolumns than do healthy controls (top image). What does this difference mean for information processing? Smaller minicolumns favor the process of discrimination, described in Chapter 8 as distinguishing among stimuli, while larger minicolumns favor generalization, or applying a response to similar stimuli. Behavioral domains that are difficult for people with ASD, such as language, face recognition, and following another person’s gaze, require more generalization than discrimination.In a meta-analysis involving over 1 million children, no relationship was found between ASD and vaccination in general, vaccination with the measles-mumps-rubella combination, or thimerosal (Taylor, Swerdfeger, & Eslick, 2014; see Figure 14.6). Despite the clear data and reassurances from medical experts, however, worried parents have withheld vaccinations from their children, leading to increasing numbers of cases of life-threatening, preventable diseases that had previously been believed to be under control. For example, in the first half of 2008, measles cases in the United States doubled compared to the rates observed between 2000 and 2007, and all cases involved unvaccinated school children (CDC, 2008).Cumulative exposure to thimerosal, a mercury-containing preservative that has been used in vaccines, was the same for children diagnosed with ASD and healthy controls. Despite clear scientific evidence contradicting the link between vaccines and autism, many people have been influenced by celebrities such as model Jenny McCarthy and have withheld vaccinations from their children. As a result, communities are facing epidemics of clearly avoidable and disabling diseases, such as measles.

 is perhaps one of the most contentious categories described in the DSM-5. The criteria for the disorder are difficult to distinguish from the behaviors of many typical young children. Because many children diagnosed with ADHD are treated with medication, the stakes for accurately diagnosing the condition are high indeed.One of the DSM-5 criteria for ADHD is often fidgets with hands or feet or squirms in seat. If you have visited an elementary school classroom lately, you might have noticed that most children are active. At what point does squirming become a psychological disorder requiring medication?ADHD involves inattention and hyperactivity. Some individuals show both inattention and hyperactivity, but others show inattention without hyperactivity or vice versa (APA, 2013). The core feature of inattention is the inability to maintain sustained attention or on-task behavior for an age-appropriate length of time. This problem is evidenced in the diagnostic criteria for inattention, such as difficulties in following instructions, in organizing and completing work, and in avoiding careless mistakes. Children with hyperactivity express a high level of motor activity and find engaging in structured activities, such as waiting in line or sitting quietly in class, challenging. These children are noisy, active, and boisterous, and they often appear to take action without thinking it through. Even as adults, individuals who were diagnosed with ADHD as children have more traffic accidents than do people without the disorder (Barkley & Cox, 2007).Many of these behaviors are also seen in children who do not have psychological disorders. Although the DSM-5 provides guidelines for distinguishing between normal and abnormal inattentiveness and hyperactivity, fewer than 40% of surveyed pediatricians reported using those criteria to evaluate cases of ADHD (Wasserman et al., 1999). More than half the children in a large sample who were receiving medication for ADHD did not meet even the relaxed diagnostic criteria for the disorder, let alone the carefully constructed criteria spelled out in the DSM-5 (Angold, Erkanli, Egger, & Costello, 2000).In 2011, 11% of children between the ages of 4 and 17 years had been diagnosed with ADHD in the United States, representing an increase of 42% over rates of ADHD as recently as 2003 (Visser et al., 2014; see Figure 14.7). ADHD is diagnosed at least twice as frequently in males as in females, and females are more likely than males to be diagnosed with inattentiveness without hyperactivity (APA, 2013).The number of children diagnosed with ADHD in a 2007 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) varies dramatically by region in the United States, from a low of 5.6%–7.9% in the Southwest to 11%–15.9% in parts of the Midwest and Southeast. Reasons for these regional discrepancies are not clear, although low socioeconomic status is considered a risk factor for ADHD. The differences also might represent variations in how the diagnostic criteria are applied by local health care providers.The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH, 2009, p. 3) concluded that scientists are not sure what causes ADHD. However, twin and adoption studies support a significant role for genetics in the development of ADHD. Heritability may be 70% or more (Faraone & Mick, 2010). Environmental factors might interact with genetic risk. Known environmental risks for ADHD are lead contamination, low birth weight, and prenatal exposure to tobacco, alcohol, and other drugs (Banerjee, Middleton, & Faraone, 2007).All children can be active and noisy, but most usually learn quickly to restrict those behaviors to the right times and places. Children with ADHD often have trouble sitting quietly in class or waiting in line.ADHD is correlated with a number of structural and functional differences in the brain. The frontal lobes may be underactive in cases of ADHD (Barkley, 1997). Because the frontal lobes inhibit unwanted behavior, lower activity in this part of the brain may lead to hyperactivity and impulsivity. In addition, smaller volume in the amygdala, basal ganglia, and hippocampus, and the brain as a whole was observed in ADHD (Hoogman et al., 2017). Disruption in the corpus callosum, a major white-matter pathway connecting the two cerebral hemispheres, was correlated with the severity of symptoms in ADHD (Ameis et al., 2016).The frontal lobes, and the prefrontal areas in particular, appear to mature more slowly in children with ADHD than in healthy controls (Shaw et al., 2007). Peak cortical thickness, a measure of brain maturity, occurred in healthy controls around the age of 7.5 years, but not until the age of 10.5 years in children with ADHD. Patterns of cortical thinning during adolescence predicted which individuals would continue to experience ADHD symptoms in adulthood and which would outgrow their symptoms (Shaw et al., 2013). White-matter circuits connecting the basal ganglia and the frontal lobes matured differently in people with and without ADHD (Helpern et al., 2011). A study of 1,713 individuals between the ages of 4 and 63 years with ADHD supported the idea that ADHD involves delays in maturation (Hoogman et al., 2017).The parts of the brain implicated in ADHD, such as the prefrontal cortex and the basal ganglia, feature large amounts of dopamine activity. As will be shown in Chapter 15, most of the medications used to treat ADHD, such as methylphenidate (Ritalin), dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine or Dextrostat), or amphetamine salts (Adderall), act by boosting the activity of dopamine, suggesting that dopamine activity might be lower than usual in cases of ADHD (Volkow et al., 2009).Among the many differences observed in the brains of children with ADHD compared to those of healthy controls is the rate of brain maturity, as measured by cortical thickening. These images demonstrate areas of the brain that developed later in children with ADHD than in healthy controls. Peak cortical thickness occurred around the age of 7.5 years in healthy children but was not seen in children with ADHD until an average age of 10.5 years. This finding implies that children with ADHD can be expected to lag their age peers in some tasks, but will eventually experience improvement.As in ASD, myths about the causes of ADHD are common. Sugar is often blamed for hyperactive behavior, but evidence from carefully controlled studies does not support this belief (Milich, 1986;  Wolraich, 1996). However, as discussed in Chapter 2, a well-controlled study suggested that combinations of common food additives made normal children demonstrate more hyperactivity (McCann et al., 2007). It is unlikely that poor parenting is responsible for these symptoms (Schroeder & Kelley, 2009). Parents, however, can learn new behavioral management techniques that greatly improve their child’s behavior.DisorderSymptomsPossible Causal Factors Under InvestigationAutism spectrum disorder (ASD)Problems with social relatednessProblems with communicationRitualistic behaviorGeneticsParental ageDisruptions in brain developmentUnknown environmental influencesAttention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)InattentivenessHyperactivity/ImpulsivityGeneticsBrain development/exposure to toxinsFrontal lobe activityFood additives

 is not the most common type of disorder, affecting approximately 1% of the human population worldwide (Kessler et al., 2007), but it is one of the most dramatic. This condition influences and distorts a range of behaviors, including perception, cognition, movement, and emotion.

The DSM-5 places schizophrenia within a group of disorders called schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders (APA, 2013). Among the symptoms of schizophrenia are delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, and disorders of movement, which together indicate a state of psychosis. Schizophrenia also features negative symptoms (APA, 2013). Negative symptoms are behaviors that are seen in healthy people but not in patients. These symptoms include diminished emotional expression and avolition (APA, 2013, p. 88). A person with diminished emotional expression does not show typical outward signs of emotion, such as facial expressions and tone of voice, when an emotional response is expected. Avolition (the a means lack of) refers to a patient’s lack of volition, or goal-oriented behavior.DelusionsDelusionsA false, illogical belief.

 are defined as unrealistic beliefs. These may take a number of forms, including delusions of persecution by others (paranoia), feelings of unrealistic power or importance (grandiosity), or beliefs that others are directing one’s behavior (control).Despite having been diagnosed with schizophrenia, John Nash shared the 1994 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences. Nash was the subject of the 2001 film A Beautiful Mind, starring Russell Crowe. Sadly, both Nash and his wife were killed in a traffic accident in 2015.Some people with schizophrenia experience catatonia, which means that they maintain awkward or unusual body positions for hours at a time.HallucinationsHallucinationsA false perception.

 are false perceptions. Although hallucinations may occur in several sensory modalities, most hallucinations in schizophrenia are auditory (Tien, 1991). Patients often report hearing voices, which can be accusatory or otherwise unpleasant, contributing to the distress associated with the disorder. Auditory hallucinations are not imaginary; they are real sensations correlated with increased activity in the primary auditory cortex of the temporal lobe (Dierks et al., 1999). Simply asking patients to remember or imagine sounds did not produce the type of activity in the auditory cortex seen during an auditory hallucination, indicating that the hallucination experience is different from simple memory or imagination.A further symptom of schizophrenia involves disorganized patterns of speech. The patient jumps inexplicably from one topic to the next. People with schizophrenia appear to have difficulty inhibiting secondary meanings for some words (Titone, Levy, & Holzman, 2000). For example, the word jam can refer to either a fruit spread for toast or an impromptu musical session. Most people would use context (a conversation about food or music) to decide which meaning was appropriate. Patients with schizophrenia might not experience this filtering, leading their thoughts to jump from food to jazz and then on to other atypical connections.This loosening of associations among ideas might occur because of the reduced latent inhibition in patients with schizophrenia, as discussed in Chapter 8. According to this argument, latent inhibition typically results in fewer associations being made to familiar stimuli. If you have had a lot of experience connecting jam and food, you are unlikely to consider other uses of the word jam. The person with schizophrenia, however, would be less inhibited in making connections among ideas, leading to trains of thought that seem bizarre to the rest of us.Schizophrenia also features grossly disorganized or abnormal motor behavior (APA, 2013, p. 88). Some people may be unusually active, while others may barely move throughout an entire day. Unusual behaviors can occur, including grimaces and gestures. The maintenance of awkward or unusual body positions for hours at a time is called catatonia. People experiencing catatonia appear aware of their surroundings, but they don’t move. Most of us would find it difficult to sit for a few minutes, let alone hours, without shifting position.

Like many other types of psychological disorders, it is likely that schizophrenia has multiple sources of causality. No one factor is likely to be sufficient to produce the disorder.Significant evidence points to a genetic vulnerability for schizophrenia. People with close family members who have been diagnosed with schizophrenia are more likely to develop the disorder themselves (Gottesman, 1991). If one identical twin is diagnosed with the disorder, the other twin has nearly a 50% lifetime risk of developing the disorder (see Figure 14.8). Comparisons of adopted children with their biological and adoptive parents also support a role for genetics (Kety, Rosenthal, Wender, & Schulsinger, 1968). A large number of genes have been implicated in the development of schizophrenia and overlap with those involved with bipolar disorder (Cross-Disorder Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, 2013;  Owen, Craddock, & Jablensky, 2007). In one case of identical triplets, two of the triplets were diagnosed with schizophrenia and the third was diagnosed with bipolar disorder (McGuffin, Reveley, & Holland, 1982).A person’s lifetime risk of developing schizophrenia increases when closely related family members have been diagnosed with the disorder, suggesting that genes play a significant role. Having a spouse with schizophrenia doubles the risk (from 1% to 2%), which probably reflects the tendency for people to marry others with whom they share similarities.A number of structural and biochemical features accompany schizophrenia. One reliable correlate of schizophrenia is the presence of enlarged ventricles (Yotsutsuji et al., 2003). As discussed in Chapter 4, the ventricles are fluid-filled spaces in the brain that are not responsible for any particular behavior. The ventricles enlarge in response to any condition resulting in a loss of neural tissue in adjacent areas, so we can assume that schizophrenia is associated with neural degeneration.Patients with schizophrenia demonstrate differences in brain activity compared with healthy people. For example, patients with schizophrenia often show a lower level of frontal lobe activity than that of healthy controls, both at rest and during effortful cognitive tasks (Berman, Torrey, Daniel, & Weinberger, 1992). The importance of the frontal lobes to higher cognitive processes and attention suggests that this difference would have significant influences on behavior, and lower levels of activity might account for the emotional disturbances and social withdrawal seen in these patients (Andreasen et al., 1992). Pathways in the brain that manage olfaction, or the sense of smell, travel through the frontal lobe. Lower overall frontal lobe activity might account for some difficulties that patients with schizophrenia experience with their sense of smell. In addition, distortions in the brain’s default mode network (see Chapter 6) predict the severity of patients’ psychotic symptoms (Garrity et al., 2007; Pomarol-Clotet et al., 2008).Magnetic resonance images of the brains of a pair of identical twins show the differences in the size of the lateral ventricles (arrows) found in healthy people (left) and in people with schizophrenia (right). The ventricles are fluid-filled spaces and enlarge whenever significant numbers of nearby neurons have died.Schizophrenia might involve abnormal brain development during adolescence. Teens typically experience a burst of cortical gray matter growth at puberty, followed by a wave of thinning of the gray matter extending into their early 20s. Healthy teens experience little loss of gray matter, whereas teens diagnosed with schizophrenia experience a loss that has been likened to a forest fire (Thompson et al., 2001).Abnormalities in dopamine activity might be the major biochemical culprit in schizophrenia. Drugs that boost dopamine activity, such as amphetamine and the Parkinson’s disease treatment l-dopa, can produce hallucinations and paranoid delusions (Goetz, Leurgans, Pappert, Raman, & Stemer, 2001). Medications that block dopamine activity are usually quite effective in reducing these same symptoms.However, this dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia is not perfect. About one fourth of patients with schizophrenia do not respond favorably to drugs that reduce dopamine activity. In particular, the negative symptoms, such as diminished emotional expression, are not improved by these drugs (Goff & Evins, 1998;  Kane & Freeman, 1994). In addition, medications that influence neurotransmitters other than dopamine are often effective (Syvalahti, 1994). Finally, phencyclidine (PCP, or angel dust) produces a syndrome that is quite similar to schizophrenia, although PCP acts on synapses using glutamate, not dopamine (Mössner et al., 2008). Because glutamate and dopamine are often important to the same brain circuits, it is possible that disturbances in one, the other, or both could lead to similar behavioral outcomes. Disturbances in the balance between brain excitation and inhibition, not related to any one neurochemical system, might also contribute to symptoms of schizophrenia (Jardri et al., 2016).The nearly 50% concordance rate for schizophrenia in identical twins indicates a role for genetics in the development of the disorder. However, 50% is not 100%, and we need to account for the remaining factors.When the brain activity of these identical twins is observed through brain imaging, the frontal lobes (arrows) appear to be more active in the healthy twin (left) than in the twin with schizophrenia (right). Red and yellow areas indicate greater activity, while green and dark areas are relatively inactive.Extreme stress contributes to the appearance and severity of schizophrenia among genetically vulnerable people. Schizophrenia appears nearly five times more frequently in members of lower than in those of higher socioeconomic groups (Keith, Regier, & Rae, 1991). The stress of living in poverty may trigger schizophrenia in vulnerable individuals. However, others argue that people who are susceptible to schizophrenia drift into lower-paying jobs. In other words, the disorder reduces the patients’ socioeconomic status, accounting for the higher rates of the disorder among the poor. Other stresses might accompany a person’s minority status in a community (Boydell, 2003). African immigrants living in London neighborhoods with the lowest proportions of African immigrants were twice as likely to be diagnosed with schizophrenia as African immigrants living in neighborhoods with the highest proportion of minorities (see Figure 14.9). The stress of social isolation because of minority status may have contributed to higher rates of schizophrenia.African immigrants living in South London were more likely to be diagnosed with schizophrenia if they lived in a predominantly White neighborhood than if they lived in a primarily non-White neighborhood; that is, if you divide neighborhoods into thirds based on the percentage of non-Whites (high, medium, and low), schizophrenia was more common in the middle and lower groups. An explanation based on self-selection (people choosing to live in each type of neighborhood) is unlikely in this case because nearly all the study participants were assigned to public housing units rather than choosing where to live. These findings suggest that the stress of minority status might contribute to higher risk for schizophrenia.When we talk about environmental influences, factors such as stress come to mind (see Chapter 16). However, environmental influences also include biological variables such as the prenatal environment, including the pregnant woman’s exposure to viral illness. Another environmental variable that might trigger schizophrenia in genetically vulnerable individuals is marijuana use (Kelley et al., 2016;  Marconi, Di Forti, Lewis, Murray, & Vassos, 2016). A 25-year longitudinal study concluded that cannabis use nearly doubled the risk of schizophrenia (Fergusson, Horwood, & Ridder, 2005). As mentioned in Chapter 11, adolescence is a time of brain growth, and heavy marijuana use during this period produces a reduction in white matter volume in the frontal lobes that might interact with a person’s genetic vulnerabilities for schizophrenia (Ho et al., 2011).Teens typically experience a burst of gray matter growth at puberty, followed by a wave of gray matter thinning that extends into their early 20s. Compared with their healthy peers, teens diagnosed with schizophrenia experience much greater gray matter loss. Purple and red areas indicate the greatest amount of loss, followed by yellow and green areas.

, which may or may not be followed by a period of depression. The symptoms of depression that can accompany bipolar disorder are identical to those used to diagnose major depressive disorder, which is described in What Is Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)? of this chapter.A manic phase consists of a distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood, abnormally and persistently increased goal-directed activity or energy (APA, 2013, p. 124). Patients may demonstrate grandiosity, in which they feel unrealistically special or important. The person’s behavior, characterized by little need for sleep, rapid speech, difficulty concentrating, and rapidly shifting ideas, seems to be running at an abnormally high speed. Unlike many other disorders, however, mania increases productive, goal-directed behavior. However, because of the person’s tendency to meet the DSM-5 criterion for excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful consequences, hospitalization is often necessary for the patient’s protection (APA, 2013, p. 124). Many variations occur in the timing and severity of the mania and depression observed in bipolar disorder.Bipolar disorder affects approximately 2.6% of American adults each year (Kessler et al., 2005). Women are more likely to be diagnosed with bipolar disorder than men, by a ratio of approximately 3:2 (CDC, 2013). The average age of onset for bipolar disorder is 25 years. Children and youth under the age of 18 years with symptoms of bipolar disorder are diagnosed instead with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (APA, 2013).Actors, actresses, poets, painters, and musicians seem to have a disproportionate risk for bipolar disorder compared to people in other occupations. The late Carrie Fisher, of Star Wars fame, was outspoken regarding her challenges with bipolar disorder. We do not know whether having bipolar disorder allows these creative people to express emotion more effectively in their art, the arts are simply more welcoming than the corporate boardroom to those who have psychological disorders, or some combination of the two.Genetic predispositions play a significant role in bipolar disorder. Concordance rates between identical twins for bipolar disorder are commonly reported to be as high as 70% (Craddock & Sklar, 2013). Adoption studies also support a powerful role for genetics (Taylor, Faraone, & Tsuang, 2002). As mentioned previously, there is considerable overlap between the genes believed to play a role in bipolar disorder and those implicated in schizophrenia. Not surprisingly because of their genetic overlap, bipolar disorder shares some of the same abnormalities in brain structure and function as observed in schizophrenia (De Peri et al., 2012; Van Haren et al., 2012).Among the many possible environmental factors that could interact with genes associated with bipolar disorder is diet. Omega-3 fatty acids, generally found in fish, may provide some protection from bipolar disorder (Noaghiul & Hibbeln, 2003). As shown in Figure 14.10, prevalence rates for bipolar disorder are highest in countries where fish is rarely consumed (such as Germany) and lowest in countries where fish is an important diet staple (such as Iceland). However, attempts to improve symptoms in patients with bipolar disorder by administering omega-3 supplements have produced weak results (Murphy et al., 2012;  Stahl, Begg, Weisinger, & Sinclair, 2008). The impact of omega-3 fatty acids on a person’s vulnerability for bipolar disorder might be more important during prenatal development than later in life.Rates of bipolar disorder are negatively correlated with a nation’s consumption of seafood, suggesting that the omega-3 fatty acids contained in seafood might help prevent bipolar disorder.Many unanswered questions regarding the development of this condition remain. Bipolar disorder may be overrepresented in groups of people with artistic and creative talent (Jamison, 1993,  1995). Based on biographical accounts, the poet William Blake, the composers George Frideric Handel and Gustav Mahler, and visual artists Vincent van Gogh and Michelangelo might have had bipolar disorder. Many noted actors and actresses, including Carrie Fisher (Star Wars) and Vivien Leigh (Gone with the Wind), have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Comparisons between people with bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder and healthy people in creative and noncreative professions support this hypothesis. The patients with bipolar disorder scored similarly on tests of creativity to healthy people in creative occupations and higher than people with major depression and healthy people in noncreative occupations (Santosa et al., 2007). The parts of the brain that are affected in bipolar disorder are similar to those seen in cases of frontotemporal dementia. In both conditions, lower activity in these areas may reduce inhibition, which in turn leads to more creativity in some individuals (Seeley et al., 2008).

Although most of us experience the occasional blues, these feelings are not as severe or chronic as the depressed feelings that characterize major depressive disorder. According to the DSM-5, major depressive disorder (MDD)major depressive disorder (MDD)A disorder characterized by lengthy periods of depressed mood, loss of pleasure in normal activities, disturbances in sleep and appetite, difficulty concentrating, feelings of hopelessness, and possible thoughts of suicide.

 is characterized by depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, for a period of at least 2 weeks (APA, 2013). Patients with MDD complain about feeling sad and empty, and periods of tearfulness are common. The DSM-5 also notes that MDD can produce anhedonia, or loss of pleasure. You are probably already familiar with the term hedonist, which refers to a person who is a pleasure seeker. Anhedonia refers to a person’s disinterest in activities that previously provided pleasure, such as sex, eating, or social activities.To be diagnosed with MDD, a person must show at least five symptoms, one of which must be either depressed mood or anhedonia. The remaining symptoms can be divided into physical and cognitive groups. The physical symptoms of MDD are related to disturbances in autonomic function typically found in the presence of high levels of stress, described in Chapter 16. Appetite and sleep may be disturbed. Some patients experience a loss of appetite, whereas others begin to eat too much. As observed in Chapter 6, many patients with depression experience frequent wakefulness, whereas others experience oversleeping (more than 9 hours per night). Fatigue or restlessness may occur. Among the cognitive symptoms of depression are difficulty concentrating, feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness, and in some cases, thoughts of suicide (APA, 2013).

MDD is one of the most frequently diagnosed psychological disorders, affecting approximately 7% of the adult population each year (APA, 2013). MDD decreases with age, and people between the ages of 18 and 29 years have rates that are three times as high as those for people over the age of 60 years.Women experience MDD more frequently than men do (Nolen-Hoeksema, 1987;  Nolen-Hoeksema, Larson, & Grayson, 1999). This discrepancy between rates of MDD in men and those in women has been observed to be independent of race, ethnicity, social class, and country of residence (Strickland, 1992;  Üstün, Ayuso-Mateos, Chatterji, Mathers, & Murray, 2004; see Figure 14.11). It is possible that female hormones participate in mood through some unknown mechanism. Mood disturbances can be associated with hormonal changes in women, including postpartum depression and mood changes accompanying menopause (Rapkin, Mikacich, Moatakef-Imani, & Rasgon, 2002). However, it is also possible that women are more likely than men to admit feeling depressed to others and to seek help with depression. Men may mask or cover their depressed mood by engaging in activities such as drinking alcohol.Across many cultures, women are diagnosed with depression more frequently than men.

Theories attempting to explain MDD range from the learning, social, and cognitive to the strictly biological. It is likely that some combination of these approaches provides the greatest understanding of the sources of depression.According to learning theories, MDD occurs when a person experiences a reduction in positive reinforcement or an increase in negative outcomes. The loss of an important relationship can lead to depression because it reduces the amount of positive reinforcement that a person experiences.A variation of the learning approach suggests that MDD results from learned helplessnesslearned helplessnessA state in which experiencing random or uncontrolled consequences leads to feelings of helplessness and possibly depression

, which is an application of operant conditioning. Instead of experiencing consequences that are clearly linked to your previous behavior (I studied hard and earned an A on my test), learned helplessness occurs when consequences of behavior appear to be random or uncontrolled (the amount of studying that I do doesn’t seem to make a difference in my test grades). If you get low grades whether you study hard or not, you might begin to believe that grades are outcomes that cannot be controlled. You may begin to feel helpless in preparing for your exams, and this belief in your own helplessness can lead to depression.Cognitive theories frame depression as the result of a combination of negative thoughts about the self, the world, and the future (Beck, 1975). For example, students failing an exam might respond by doubting their academic abilities (self), assuming that they will fail the course (future), and deciding that they hate the class (world). The resulting dysfunctional beliefs would lead to depression. Beck’s view of the development of depression led directly to the use of cognitive therapies for depression, which are discussed in Chapter 15.Rates of both depression and rumination drop in middle adulthood. Young adults often find it frustrating when they are trying to ruminate about problems with their parents, only to have their parents immediately shift into problem-solving mode. The young adult might not feel ready to fix the problem yet.Another cognitive process that contributes to the development and maintenance of depressed mood is rumination (Nolen-Hoeksema, 2003). Susan Nolen-Hoeksema describes rumination in depression as repetitively focusing on the fact that one is depressed; on one’s symptoms of depression; and on the causes, meanings, and consequences of symptoms of depression (Nolen-Hoeksema, 1991, p. 569). Rumination can arise from attempts to gain insight into one’s problems, but too much rumination interferes with problem solving (Watkins & Brown, 2002). When rumination is encouraged by asking study participants to focus on their mood, they find it difficult to solve several types of problems (see Figure 14.12). When the participants are distracted from this inward focus by thinking about neutral topics (such as think about the Statue of Liberty), their problem-solving abilities improve immediately. Typically, rumination is correlated with negative outcomes, including delaying recovery from MDD during treatment (Siegle, Sagratti, & Crawford, 1999), predicting MDD following the death of a loved one (Nolen-Hoeksema & Girgus, 1994) and increasing a person’s likelihood to abuse alcohol (Nolen-Hoeksema, 2003). Responding to problems by either ruminating or distracting oneself might help explain some gender differences in depression rates. Women are more likely to ruminate than men, whose coping strategies are more likely to consist of finding distractions (Nolen-Hoeksema, 1987;  Nolen-Hoeksema, Larson, & Grayson, 1999).Rumination and distraction were induced in depressed and nondepressed study participants, who then completed a problem-solving task. To induce rumination, participants were instructed to think about what your feelings mean. To induce distraction, participants were asked to think about the shape of a large black umbrella. Subsequently, all participants were asked to complete a problem-solving task. More errors occurred in the depressed ruminating group than in the other groups. These results suggest that rumination competes with other cognitive processes, possibly contributing to the problems with concentration experienced by people with depression.MDD might be influenced by the types of attributions that a person makes (Abramson, Seligman, & Teasdale, 1978). As mentioned in Chapter 13, an attribution is a belief about causality. Attributions can vary along several dimensions (internal–external, stable–unstable, or global–specific), and making some types of attributions might predispose a person to depression. The internal–external dimension, which is similar to the locus of control discussed in Chapter 12, represents beliefs that outcomes occur because of personal effort or because of luck or chance. The stable–unstable dimension captures beliefs about whether circumstances can change. People make global attributions (I’m stupid) or more specific attributions (I’m not great in algebra, but I’m good at geometry). Overall, people who make internal, stable, and global attributions (what happens to me is my fault, circumstances never change, and I’m always this way) are more prone to depression. People with this attributional style earn lower grades in college, perform more poorly as sales representatives, and experience worse health (Seligman, 1987).Depression reflects feeling generally sad, whereas loneliness is a more social process that reflects feeling badly about the state of one’s relationships with others. The two states are related, yet they can occur independently. In older adults, loneliness increased depressive symptoms, but depression did not increase loneliness (Cacioppo, Hawkley, & Thisted, 2010). Social and evolutionary theories of depression and loneliness suggest that these states might promote an individual’s survival by promoting better relationships with others (Allen & Badcock, 2003;  Cacioppo, Cacioppo, & Boomsma, 2014;  Cacioppo, Hughes, Waite, Hawkley, & Thisted, 2006). Expressions of depression, such as sad facial expressions and crying, can serve as a safe call to others for connection and comforting responses in what the person may feel is a threatening social context. The response of others to these signals may foster the repair of frayed or broken social connections. Even when others do not respond, the symptoms of MDD may protect people from additional negative interactions by reducing their social activities.The biological perspective identifies a number of factors contributing to depression. Twin studies suggest that the heritability of MDD is about 40% (Shi et al., 2011). A number of genes have been implicated in depression, including genes affecting serotonin function (Wurtman, 2005). A large body of research points to a role for serotonin in the regulation of mood. Serotonin’s role in brain systems responsible for mood, appetite, and sleep corresponds closely to the symptoms of MDD outlined in the DSM-5. Most effective medications for the treatment of depression boost the activity of serotonin at the synapse.The anterior cingulate cortex plays an important role in regulating emotion through its connections with the amygdala. In many cases of MDD, the cingulate cortex appears to be overactive. Reductions in activity in the anterior cingulate cortex are correlated with improved mood following several different types of treatments.MDD might be part of a larger disturbance in daily, or circadian, rhythms (Soria et al., 2010). Among the genes suspected of being related to MDD are those involved with circadian rhythms (see Chapter 6; also see McClung, 2007). The DSM-5 criteria for MDD include sleeping either less than or more than a normal number of hours per night (7–9 hours) (APA, 2013). People who are depressed spend too much time in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and most medications that are used to treat MDD reduce REM sleep (Rijnbeek, de Visser, Franson, Cohen, & van Gerven, 2003) (see Figure 14.14).These sleep records show the normal progression of non-REM and REM sleep (upper row) and the disrupted sleep of a person with major depressive disorder (bottom row). Note the lack of Stage 3 and 4 non-REM sleep and the frequent waking experienced by the person with depression (see Chapter 6 for more information).How does the world look to a person who is depressed? Does the experience of depression affect a person’s attention to negative stimuli? As mentioned in Chapter 7, positive and negative emotions often serve as guides to approach and avoidance behaviors (Davidson & Irwin, 1999). Because it is usually more important to survival that we avoid predators and other dangers than that we miss approaching something positive, such as a tasty food, we have a bias toward noticing the negative. If we’re experiencing an ongoing negative mood, does that have an effect on our sensitivities to positive and negative stimuli?Among the important types of positive and negative stimuli that we need to process are facial expressions, because these are our clues to navigating the social environment successfully. Few of us would miss dramatic facial expressions, but the subtle ones require more attention (Gollan, McCloskey, Hoxha, & Coccaro, 2010).The Question: How do people with depression compare to control participants in their ability to detect subtle facial expressions of emotion?In one study, 88 participants, half of whom had been diagnosed with major depressive disorder but were not treated with medication, observed photographs of facial expressions on a computer screen. The photographs depicted four basic emotions: happiness, surprise, sadness, and harsh (a category that combined photos showing disgust, fear, and anger). The photos were morphed to present intensities ranging from mostly neutral to very intense (see Figure 14.13). A total of 200 photos were presented for only 0.5 second each. The participants pushed one of six keys to identify the emotion being expressed.Study participants see one photo for only 0.5 second and must determine which of six emotions (happiness, surprise, sadness, disgust, fear, or anger) is being displayed. Morphed images are made by combining neutral (0%) and high-intensity (100%) images. Each emotion is easier to identify as its intensity increases. Participants with depression needed to see the same amount of intensity as healthy control participants before correctly identifying happy, surprised, or harsh facial expressions but needed to see less intensity than control participants before correctly identifying sad faces. This heightened sensitivity to the sad moods of others might reinforce the negative feelings of the person with depression.It is unlikely that this procedure would produce distress in any of the participants. Because some of the participants are identified as having a psychological disorder, great care should be taken to protect their confidentiality.The participants with depression were more sensitive to sad faces than the control participants were. Specifically, all participants identified strong expressions of sadness, but participants with depression were more accurate in the identification of sadness when the emotion was expressed at a lower intensity. The groups were equally accurate in identifying the positive emotions (happiness and surprise) and the harsh emotions (fear, anger, and disgust). The severity of the participants’ depression was positively correlated with their accuracy in recognizing sad faces, but not with their accuracy in recognizing other emotional expressions.The participants with depression were more sensitive to subtle expressions of sadness than the healthy control participants, and they were more likely to misidentify other emotional facial expressions as sad. In contrast, they were just as likely as control participants to misidentify happy, surprised, or harsh facial expressions. These findings indicate that people with depression not only are more likely to attend to sadder stimuli, but also might misinterpret neutral facial stimuli as sad. These tendencies might reinforce a person’s depressive feelings.Major depressive disorder might result from more global problems with circadian or daily biorhythms. Among the candidate genes producing vulnerability for major depressive disorder are those that contribute to individual circadian rhythms.People who are depressed sometimes think about suicide or even make suicide attempts (see Figure 14.15). Because of the greater prevalence of major depressive disorder in younger people, they are also at greater risk of suicide. Approximately 1,100 college students in the United States die in suicides each year, making suicide the second-leading cause of death in this population (Wilcox et al., 2010).Among individuals experiencing at least one depressive episode in the past year, thinking seriously about suicide and making a suicide attempt happened frequently.These statistics raise the possibility that as a college student, you may become aware of another person’s risk for suicide. According to the American Foundation of Suicide Prevention (AFSP), we can make ourselves aware of risk factors and take actions that might save a life (AFSP, 2014). Among these risk factors are evidence of a psychological disorder (particularly depression), alcohol and other substance use, a history of suicide attempts, being male (males have a three to five times higher suicide completion rate than females), and impulsivity. More immediately, the occurrence of a traumatic event (job loss or ending of an important relationship) might increase a person’s risk.Approximately 75% of individuals who attempt suicide show prior evidence of their intent (AFSP, 2014). People might say things like My family would be better off without me or speak in ways that indicate they are saying good-bye. Purchasing a gun or putting one’s affairs in order (e.g., giving away prized possessions like a computer) is a sign of risk. Hopelessness, rage, or increased use of drugs and alcohol is also a common response to feeling suicidal (AFSP, 2014).If you suspect someone of being suicidal, experts advise you to take the situation seriously. Yes, it may be true that some people cry wolf, but with a life at stake, who wants to take that chance? Be a good listener, and reassure the person that depression can be treated, that he or she is not alone, and that you care. If possible, take your friend to a place where professional help is available, whether that is your campus health center or a local emergency room. Do not leave the person alone, and remove possible means of self-harm (drugs, weapons, etc.). If such steps are not possible, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline (800-273-TALK) or 911.Understanding that the combination of depression, impulsivity, alcohol or substance use, a history of suicide attempts, and a recent breakup or other traumatic event may increase the risk of suicide can help us offer support to a person who exhibits these characteristics.The experience of severe stress, whether arising from the death of a loved one, illness, or frustration of major life goals, frequently occurs immediately before the onset of a depressive episode (Brown & Harris, 1989;  Mazure, 1998). The physical and cognitive responses to high levels of stress, such as difficulty sleeping or concentrating, are quite similar to the symptoms of MDD. However, most people exposed to such stressors do not respond by becoming depressed, reinforcing the complexity of the development of this disorder. MDD provides an example of a diathesis–stress modeldiathesis–stress modelA model that suggests that the experience of stress interacts with an individual’s biological predisposition to produce a psychological disorder.

, which suggests that biological vulnerabilities for a disorder interact with a person’s experience with stress (Zubin & Spring, 1977).The picture emerging from this discussion of causal factors in MDD is complex. It is likely that underlying biological predispositions interact with cognitive patterns and life events to produce the disorder. For example, the serotonin transporter gene, which has been discussed previously in this book in the contexts of personality and responses to bullying, does little by itself to help predict a person’s risk for MDD. However, among people experiencing significant stress, those with one or two copies of the short version of the gene were more likely than those with two copies of the long version to develop MDD (Caspi et al., 2003).A biological bridge is formed across the experience of stress, circadian rhythms, and the development of depression by the release of hormones (e.g., cortisol) when the stressor is perceived. Cortisol levels follow circadian patterns, with the greatest cortisol release in the early morning followed by a gradual drop throughout the day and evening. However, cortisol is also released at times of stress and helps prepare the body for fight or flight. Feedback loops involving the hippocampus usually prevent too great a release of cortisol. It is possible that in cases of MDD, this feedback loop is not working correctly, and cortisol levels remain high (Stokes, 1995). The body simply cannot maintain high levels of arousal indefinitely, and MDD may result.DisorderSymptomsPossible Causal Factors Under InvestigationSchizophreniaDelusionsHallucinationsDisorganized thought and speechMovement disordersRestricted affectAvolition or asocialityGeneticsReduced frontal lobe activityDisruption of brain developmentDopamine and glutamate abnormalitiesStressPrenatal environmentMarijuana useBipolar disorderElevated moodGrandiosityLittle need for sleepRapid speechDifficulty concentratingPossible depressionGeneticsSerotonin disturbancesDietMajor depressive disorderChronic depressed moodLack of pleasureSleep disturbancesAppetite disturbancesDifficulty concentratingHopelessnessPossible suicidal thoughtsLoss of positive reinforcementLearned helplessnessNegative cognitionsRuminationDepressive attributionsStressGeneticsReduced serotonin activityPatterns of brain activityCircadian rhythms

Anxiety disorders take many forms, but all share the core characteristic of unrealistic and counterproductive levels of anxiety. Anxiety has two major components: strong negative emotions andphysical tension because of the anticipation of danger (Barlow, 1988). It is the anticipation of danger that separates anxiety from the closely related emotion of fear. When we are afraid, usually something is happening in the present to produce that feeling, whereas anxiety occurs when we are worried about the future.

 represent an exaggeration of what is normally a useful response. Normal levels of anxiety protect us from engaging in risky activities, such as running up debts, driving recklessly, or failing to prepare for work or school, but excessive anxiety can cause a person to withdraw from positive life experiences and interpersonal relationships.Nearly 30% of all Americans experience one or more anxiety disorders during their lifetime, although not all seek treatment (Kessler et al., 2005). People have genetic vulnerabilities for anxiety disorders in general, but not for specific types of anxiety disorders (DiLalla, Kagan, & Reznick, 1994). Families with members who are diagnosed with anxiety disorders are also likely to have members diagnosed with depression because these types of problems appear to share an underlying genetic basis (Weissman, Warner, Wickramaratne, Moreau, & Olfson, 1997). Anxiety disorders differ across gender and ethnicity for reasons that are not well understood. Women are more likely to be diagnosed with anxiety disorders than are men, and African Americans and Hispanics living in the United States are less likely to be diagnosed with anxiety disorders than are White Americans (Kessler et al., 2005).Anxiety is the anticipation of danger. Normal levels of anxiety remind us about the risks of engaging in dangerous activities, but disordered anxiety can prevent people from engaging in everyday activities.Evidence of a predisposition to anxiety appears early in life (Biederman et al., 1990;  Schwartz, Snidman, & Kagan, 1999). As observed in Chapters 11 and 12, children’s initial temperament and reactivity can predispose them to anxiety. In one study, young infants showed consistent levels of response to novel stimuli, such as the smell of cotton swabs dipped in alcohol (Kagan, 1997), and 20% of the infants were classified as high reactives to these stimuli because of their increased activity and distress when novel stimuli were presented. When the high-reactive children were placed in a novel laboratory environment at the ages of 4–5 years, they still showed heightened levels of anxiety compared to their peers.For reasons that are currently poorly understood, a number of psychological disorders appear to be more prevalent in some racial and ethnic groups than others. Possible reasons for these discrepancies include true differences in risk, access to diagnosis and treatment, poverty, and willingness to discuss symptoms. As shown in Figure 14.16, differences appear between non-Hispanic Whites, Caribbean Blacks, and African Americans in prevalence for major depressive disorder (MDD) and general anxiety disorder (GAD) (Watkins, Assari, & Johnson-Lawrence, 2015). These data were collected from about 6,000 participants as part of the National Survey of American Life (NSAL).Data from over 6,000 participants in a national sample showed that non-Hispanic Whites, Caribbean Blacks, and African Americans differ in their rates of major depressive disorder (MDD) and GAD. The exact reasons for these differences remain unknown but might include true differences in risk, access to diagnosis and treatment, poverty, and willingness to discuss symptoms.While it is interesting and important to understand why disorders might be diagnosed more frequently in some populations compared to others,  Watkins et al. (2015) suggest an even more pressing need. In general, MDD and GAD are associated with chronic medical diseases (see Chapter 16), such as cancer, diabetes, stroke, and heart disease. However, these researchers found different patterns of connections across racial and ethnic groups. MDD, but not GAD, was associated with at least one chronic medical condition for both Caribbean Blacks and African Americans, but not for non-Hispanic Whites. Caribbean Blacks showed stronger associations with MDD and GAD and having one or more chronic medical conditions. Watkins et al. (2015) recommend that primary health-care screenings for psychological disorders among patients with chronic medical diseases could benefit from tailoring based on race and ethnicity. They argue for the importance of thinking about services for patients with chronic medical conditions who are at the apex of various racial, ethnic, and mental health intersections.Unlike most other types of psychological disorders, anxiety disorders do not impair a person’s ability to think realistically. In most cases, adults with anxiety disorders recognize that their circumstances do not warrant their extremely anxious responses, but they feel unable to control them. A person looking out the window of a skyscraper is well aware that the likelihood of falling is quite low, but feelings of fear and anxiety persist. Young children with anxiety disorders are usually less aware than adults that their feelings are unrealistic.

 are fears of objects or situations other than those associated with agoraphobia and social anxiety disorder (see Figure 14.17). These fear stimuli may be animals, natural phenomena (water or earthquakes), blood and injury, or situations (flying, heights, bridges, and so on). People do not ordinarily form phobias about harmless objects such as coffee cups and keys (Mineka, Sutton, Craske, Hermans, & Vansteenwegen, 2006).In a large random sample of adults, 21.2% of women and 10.9% of men reported having at least one specific phobia, as defined by the DSM-5. Gender differences were seen in the prevalence of situational phobias (lightning, enclosed spaces, darkness, flying, and heights) and animal phobias (primarily spiders and snakes). However, no gender differences occurred in injury phobias (injections, dentists, and injuries). More than one type of specific phobia was reported by 5.4% of the women and 1.5% of the men.The evolutionary perspective suggests that phobias might be exaggerations of an otherwise useful sense of caution. The items that become fear stimuli have some realistic potential relationship to harm, such as snakes, spiders, and the sight of blood. As noted in Chapter 8, the connections formed in phobias can arise from classical conditioning. A stimulus (conditioned stimulus, or CS) becomes associated with a negative experience (unconditioned stimulus, or UCS) that results in fear (unconditioned response, or UCR), giving the CS the ability to elicit fear (conditioned response, or CR). We might be biologically prepared to form connections between certain stimuli and feelings of fear (Seligman, 1971). Learning also can influence the development of phobias through imitation and observation, such as when a child sees a parent scream when a spider creeps across the room.People with spider phobias are often convinced that the spider is intent on harming them, when spiders are usually just being spiders.In Japan, some people experience taijin kyofusho, which is a fear of offending or embarrassing other people with their odor, eye contact, or appearance (Tarumi, Ichimiya, Yamada, Umesue, & Kuroki, 2004). This condition is significantly different from the emphasis on a person’s own embarrassment that is typical in social anxiety as experienced in Western cultures.Cognitions influence specific phobias. Even though a spider in your house or garden is simply minding its own business while doing spider things, people with spider phobias tend to believe that the spider is intending to attack them or move toward them (Riskind, Moore, & Bowley, 1995). People who have height phobias misjudge real physical heights, believing that they are higher than they really are (Stefanucci & Proffitt, 2009).

 is the fear of being scrutinized and criticized by others, particularly during public speaking and when meeting new people. Many of us are a little uneasy in these situations, but for people with social anxiety disorder, the fear and anxiety caused by these situations are out of proportion for the particular situation. In other words, the person with social anxiety disorder feels crippling anxiety while doing things that most people take in stride, like introducing yourself to others at a party. In most cases, social anxiety disorder begins during adolescence. As discussed in Chapter 12, people experience a spotlight effect, or a belief that others are scrutinizing them. For an anxious teen, this spotlight effect might be exaggerated, leading to social anxiety disorder.Morita Masatake (1874–1938) founded the Morita Therapy for the treatment of anxiety disorders, including the culture-bound syndrome taijin kyofusho, which affects 10% to 20% of the Japanese population. This condition, recognized in the DSM, is characterized by fear of offending others by blushing or by having an offensive appearance or body odor. Morita recommended treating anxiety by accepting your feelings, knowing your purpose, and doing what needs doing. His therapy continues to be used today.Cultural variables appear to be particularly significant in the development of social anxiety. Social anxiety is more prevalent in collectivistic cultures, with their emphasis on shame and the opinions of other people, than in individualistic cultures. Asian American college students were more likely than White American students to report negative emotions in social situations (Lee, Okazaki, & Yoo, 2006).

, which features repeated panic attacks and fear of future attacks (APA, 2013).Just having a panic attack does not mean that you should be diagnosed with panic disorder. It is not unusual for people to experience one or two panic attacks in their lifetime. One quarter to one third of college students report having had at least one panic attack in the previous year (Asmundson & Norton, 1993;  Brown & Cash, 1990). However, panic disorder is much less common, affecting 2.7% of the population in any given year (Kessler et al., 2005). Women are more likely to experience panic attacks and panic disorder than are men. More than half of people with panic disorder also have been diagnosed with depression or another type of anxiety disorder (Kearney, Albano, Eisen, Allan, & Barlow, 1997). Panic attacks begin to occur in adolescence and young adulthood (Robins & Regier, 1991). The Scream, a famous series of four paintings by Edvard Munch (1863–1944), was reportedly based on a panic attack that he suffered while out with two friends at sunset.By all reports, panic attacks are extremely unpleasant. Symptoms typically last about 10 minutes. Feelings of intense fear or discomfort are accompanied by both physical and cognitive symptoms. Strong arousal of the sympathetic nervous system leads to the experience of a pounding heart, sweating, trembling, shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, and dizziness or faintness. Not too surprisingly, people experiencing such symptoms may believe they are dying or going crazy. For some individuals, panic attacks may be brought on by identifiable stimuli, such as being swept along in a crowd. For others, the attacks seem to come out of nowhere. In either case, many people experiencing repeated attacks may begin to fear leaving their homes, a condition known as agoraphobia, which will be discussed in a later section.A clue to the biological origin of panic attacks is that they can be produced artificially in people with panic disorder, but not in people who do not have the disorder, by administering an injection of sodium lactate (Papp et al., 1993;  Pitts & McClure, 1967). Sodium lactate interacts with orexins, chemical messengers that were discussed in Chapters 6 and 7. Orexins, which are released by cells in the hypothalamus, play important roles in wakefulness, vigilance, and appetite. People with panic disorder have larger quantities of orexins than do people without the disorder (Johnson et al., 2010). It is possible that disturbances involving the orexins might lead to panic attacks.Cognitive theories of panic attacks suggest that the interpretation of body symptoms, such as an increased heart rate, could lead to increasing anxiety and, ultimately, to panic (Bakker, Spinhoven, van Balkom, & van Dyck, 2002;  Harvey, Watkins, Mansell, & Shafran, 2004). A person might interpret increased heart rate and rapid breathing as a heart attack instead of the result of having walked briskly from a parking lot. Concern about having a heart attack leads to further physiological arousal, which leads to more anxiety, and so on until a full state of panic is reached. Unfortunately for such theories, panic surprisingly does not increase levels of the stress hormone cortisol, which suggests that there is more to a panic attack than just responding to the stress of thinking that you are ill (Hollander et al., 1989).Social influences can be seen in the symptoms related by people with panic disorder. Many people worry about appearing weird or crazy to other people, which can lead to increased anxiety and more panic attacks (Hicks et al., 2005). Culture plays an important role in how panic attacks are interpreted. Although the underlying physical characteristics remain similar from country to country, interesting variations have been observed. For example, dizziness is an important aspect of panic attacks in China, constipation and shortness of breath are common symptoms of panic in Rwanda, and gastrointestinal symptoms signal panic for patients in Thailand (Hinton & Good, 2009). Social factors also influence the development of panic disorder. Panic disorder is more common in children who have experienced parental loss or separation and in adults who have recently experienced significant, stressful life events (Klauke, Deckert, Reif, Pauli, & Domschke, 2010).A combination of the factors just discussed is likely to provide the best explanation for the development and experience of panic disorder. A panic attack could occur as a result of a chain of events: A person with a biological predisposition to panic, possibly involving the orexin systems of the brain,is exposed to social stressors in the form of parental loss or separation or significant life stressors,interprets physical symptoms of arousal as threatening or embarrassing, and finallyhas cognitions leading to panic that are modulated by that individual’s cultural expectations.

 is the fear of open spaces and is named after the ancient Greek agora, or marketplace. As mentioned previously, agoraphobia is a common outcome of panic disorder. When people become afraid of the embarrassment of having panic attacks in public, they might opt to simply stay home. Fear can occur in a number of situations, including being outside the home alone, using public transportation, being in open spaces such as parking lots or in shops, or standing in line or in a crowd. Agoraphobia often prevents working or engaging in normal social activities (Kessler et al., 2005).People with agoraphobia or fear of open places often fear being in crowds, like this one in Times Square in New York City.

 is diagnosed when a person has experienced excessive anxiety and worry for 6 months that is not correlated with particular objects or situations (APA, 2013). In other words, the person experiences a great deal of worry, but the worry is focused on life in general, not upcoming midterms or spiders. GAD is associated with physical complaints, including headache, stomachache, and muscle tension. GAD is often comorbid, or coexisting, with other anxiety disorders, substance abuse, and depression (APA, 2013).Like all anxiety disorders, GAD shows evidence of genetic predisposition (Kendler et al., 1995;  Molina et al., 2011). A reasonable place to start looking for correlates of anxiety in brain structure and function is the fear circuit involving the amygdala, which was discussed in Chapters 4 and 7. The amygdala is particularly rich in receptors for GABA, a neurotransmitter that inhibits brain activity. As discussed in Chapter 6, drugs such as alcohol and the benzodiazepine tranquilizers (e.g., Valium) have their main anxiety-reducing effects at these GABA receptors. Not too surprisingly, then, people often self-medicate with alcohol and tranquilizers to reduce their anxiety level, leaving them vulnerable to substance abuse disorders.The amygdala forms complex connections with the prefrontal areas of the frontal lobe (see Figure 14.18). As observed in the discussion of aggression in Chapter 13, the prefrontal cortex coordinates our decisions based on potential dangers identified by the amygdala. For example, if you see a driver’s angry face in your rearview mirror, your amygdala alerts the prefrontal cortex about a potential threat or danger, and your prefrontal cortex uses memories of similar past experiences and reasoning to decide to pull over safely to the slower lane to let the angry driver go by. It is possible that this circuit is not responding typically in cases of GAD.People with GAD have higher levels of activity in the cortex, thalamus, amygdala, and hypothalamus (Wittchen & Hoyer, 2001). The prefrontal cortex was especially active when people with GAD saw angry faces, suggesting that this area had to work harder to control incoming danger signals from the amygdala (Monk et al., 2008).Several cognitive models of GAD have been proposed (Beck, 1985). As discussed in Chapters 10 and 11, we often organize our thinking about the world into schemas, or systems of belief. If a high-reactive child develops a schema that says The world is a dangerous place, even safe experiences begin to look dangerous through this filter. A different cognitive approach suggests that worrying can become a coping strategy for anxiety. By examining what ifs, people might believe that they are coping, but so many situations are capable of triggering the coping response that the result is nearly constant worry (Wells, 2006). Bill Murray’s character in the 1991 film What About Bob? expresses this type of worry when he asks his psychiatrist, What if my bladder explodes?Individuals in lower socioeconomic classes in the United States are about twice as likely to be diagnosed with GAD as people in middle or upper socioeconomic classes (Kessler et al., 2005). Disruptions in social connectivity because of divorce, separation, death of a spouse, or loss of a job also are associated with higher rates of GAD (Wittchen & Hoyer, 2001).Pulling these perspectives together into an integrated model, we might predict that GAD is most likely to occur in individuals with a high-reactive temperament, possibly because of their genetic background, who subsequently develop schemas and other cognitive patterns that maintain high levels of worry. When these individuals experience unusual amounts of stress because of socioeconomic factors and disruption of social networks, their risk for developing GAD is likely to be even higher.

The DSM-5 groups obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), which was formerly an anxiety disorder, with body dysmorphic disorder, hoarding disorder, and other similar problems (APA, 2013).

); or both. Between 2% and 3% of the U.S. population report experiencing OCD during their lifetime (Ruscio, Stein, Chiu, & Kessler, 2010).Obsessions are distinct from everyday worries, which usually focus on real-life problems. Common obsessions include concerns about contamination (catching diseases from shaking hands), repeated doubts (wondering whether you have hurt somebody), ordering (needing things arranged in a particular order or configuration), inappropriate impulses (hurting somebody else or shouting obscenities at a funeral), and sexual imagery (APA, 2013).Some people with obsessive-compulsive disorder must arrange their possessions in particular ways; otherwise, they will experience overwhelming anxiety.The childhood rhyme Step on a crack, break your mother’s back captures the ineffectiveness of obsessive-compulsive thinking.Compulsions appear to be efforts to ward off the anxiety produced by obsessions or some other feared event. For example, people troubled by obsessions about contamination may engage in compulsive hand washing hundreds of times per day. Other common compulsions include checking (for locked windows or faucets turned off), counting, ordering objects, and requesting or demanding assurances.Twin studies suggest a strong genetic vulnerability for the disorder, with concordance rates between identical twins of 63%–87% (Menzies et al., 2008). It is probable that significant interactions between this genetic vulnerability and the environment occur. Symptoms of OCD may arise following head trauma, the brain inflammation caused by encephalitis, and seizure disorder (Grisham, Anderson, & Sachdev, 2008). Young children who experienced birth complications or streptococcal infections (e.g., strep throat) may be more likely to develop the disorder later in life (Swedo et al., 1997).Imaging studies provide insight into the patterns of brain activity that accompany obsessions and compulsions (see Figure 14.19). Several structures, including the orbitofrontal cortex, prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate gyrus, and the caudate nucleus of the basal ganglia, appear to be more active than usual in people with OCD (Saxena, 2003;  Szeszko et al., 2004). Individuals with OCD appear to have lower than normal amounts of serotonin activity, and individuals with the lowest levels of serotonin activity experience the most severe obsessions and compulsions (Piacentini & Graae, 1997).When compared to healthy controls, people with OCD have greater gray matter density in the areas shown in red. When people with OCD experience symptoms, the areas in yellow become especially active. Areas of the orbitofrontal cortex, shown in orange, are anatomically different from those in healthy controls and are activated during OCD symptoms, suggesting an important role for the orbitofrontal cortex in OCD.The evolutionary perspective suggests that OCD might have its roots in normal grooming and territoriality behaviors that somehow become overly exaggerated in some cases (Rapoport, 1989). Humans who anticipated threats like disease from dirty hands or threats from the perimeters of their territories probably benefited from proactive strategies like hand washing and checking their surroundings (Brune, 2006). Disordered behavior similar to OCD occurs elsewhere in the animal kingdom. Dogs may lick and chew their front paws to the point of causing extensive tissue damage, which can be prevented by giving the dogs the same medications used to treat humans with OCD (Seksel & Lindeman, 2001).Learning explanations for OCD focus on the rewarding aspects of compulsions. As pointed out in the previous discussion of operant conditioning, any behavior that produces a positive outcome (reducing anxiety associated with an obsession) is likely to be repeated in the future. For example, if hand washing reduced anxiety about germs and disease, hand washing might become progressively more frequent to the point where it would be considered abnormal. The DSM-5 specifies that engaging in compulsive behavior for more than 1 hour per day is considered abnormal (APA, 2013).Culture plays a role in how frequently OCD occurs and what obsessions and compulsions are more likely. Anthropologists have identified interesting parallels between cultural rituals and OCD. For example, many normal cultural rituals involve elements similar to OCD, including washing, special colors, stereotyped actions, and rigid rules (Dulaney & Fiske, 1994). Like the evolutionary perspective, this cultural view suggests that OCD might represent an exaggerated version of normal behaviors.

        Body dysmorphic disorder
        A disorder characterized by the unrealistic perception of physical flaws
        
    
 is characterized by the unrealistic perception of physical flaws. Many people with this condition undergo numerous cosmetic surgeries. Others continually try to perfect their bodies through bodybuilding activities and other strategies.Pop entertainer Michael Jackson was described by his mother as addicted to plastic surgery. She related that during adolescence, her son became obsessed with his perceived physical flaws. Although Jackson was never formally diagnosed with body dysmorphic disorder, many people with this disorder engage in similar types of body dissatisfaction and repeated requests for plastic surgery.Body dysmorphic disorder shows a significant influence of heredity (Feusner, Neziroglu, Wilhelm, Mancusi, & Bohon, 2010). In addition, people with this disorder might not be as out of touch with reality as you might think. Their visual perception of subtle facial distortions appears to be better than normal, so they may be noticing flaws that the rest of us cannot see (Reese, McNally, & Wilhelm, 2010).

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)A disorder caused by the experience of trauma, which leads to flashbacks, dreams, hypervigilance, and avoidance of stimuli associated with the traumatic event.

 is the current term used to describe a condition formerly known as shell shock or battle fatigue. PTSD is unique among disorders listed in the DSM-5 because it is the only one with a specified cause: To be diagnosed with PTSD, you must have experienced trauma (APA, 2013). Although combat, especially hand-to-hand combat, is still recognized as one of the most likely experiences leading to PTSD, we now understand that other types of trauma may produce the same results (Insel, 2007). PTSD may follow the experience of automobile accidents, assaults, abuse, and natural disasters.Although combat remains the most frequent cause of PTSD, people who experience natural disasters, like the 2011 Japanese earthquake and tsunami, are also at risk for the disorder.PTSD symptoms include hypervigilance, avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma, emotional numbing, and reexperiencing in the form of repetitive, intrusive thoughts, flashbacks, and dreams about the traumatic event (APA, 2013). The last thing that a person in this situation wants to do is to relive the traumatic event, so these symptoms are upsetting. Children with PTSD often reenact the traumatic event in their play (Cohen, Chazan, Lerner, & Maimon, 2010). In other words, they may play terrorist attack, car crash, or tsunami, possibly in an effort to reduce their fear. This reenactment play can have either positive or negative effects on the child. Children whose play included a reworking of the traumatic event (revenge or a happy ending) were less disturbed than children whose play was repetitive, without resolution.PTSD affects between 3% and 4% of the adult population in the United States every year (Kessler et al., 2007). After large-scale traumatic events, health workers typically expect about 10% of the population to develop PTSD (Kessler, Sonnega, Bromet, Hughes, & Nelson, 1996). For example, more than 12% of lower Manhattan residents developed PTSD following the terrorist attacks of 9/11 (DiGrande et al., 2008). Children are more vulnerable than adults, with 25% developing PTSD following automobile accidents in which they were injured, compared to 15% of their parents (de Vries, 1999). Between 8.5% and 14% of combat soldiers serving in Iraq and Afghanistan experienced severe impairment because of symptoms of PTSD after returning home, and up to 31% experienced some impairment (Thomas et al., 2010).There are Hidden Costs in War. Soldiers, most of whom are about the same ages as those of you reading this textbook, are permanently changed by their experiences in ways that are often difficult for those of us who have not shared those experiences to understand. They have faced the fear of death and the realities of injury, held dying friends in their arms, and felt guilty that their lives were spared.Some cope with these challenges better than others. As stated earlier in this chapter, between 8.5% and 14% of U.S. veterans serving in Iraq and Afghanistan experience severe PTSD, and up to 31% experience some impairment (Thomas et al., 2010). Veterans usually come home to their loved ones and families, who are also affected by the soldiers’ combat experiences in what has been called secondary traumatization (Galovski & Lyons, 2004). Although not directly threatened, the soldiers’ families have had challenges of their own as they cope with their helpless fear of loss. Understanding that bad news comes to the front door in the person of a military chaplain makes each FedEx delivery or visit by a neighbor a heart-pounding experience. The spouses who have learned over the course of a year to run households independently and balance the checkbook might not want to share some of these responsibilities with their returning partners.Among the biggest challenges for veterans with PTSD and their families are the results of having symptoms of hyperarousal, emotional numbing, and stimulus avoidance (Monson, Taft, & Fredman, 2009). Although veterans without PTSD have the same rates of intimate aggression as the general population, the risk of intimate aggression is much higher in those with PTSD, and the severity of symptoms predicts the likelihood of aggression. Because of the emotional numbing and avoidance symptoms of PTSD, returning veterans do not engage in much self-disclosure, or discussion of their thoughts, feelings, and experiences. As discussed in Chapter 13, self-disclosure is an important component of intimacy.Both soldiers and their families are changed by war, and their reunions, while happy, are not always smooth. Strong social support is a critical variable in the development and course of PTSD resulting from combat.A soldier’s existing level of social support is one of the strongest protections against the initial development of PTSD (Brewin, Andrews, & Valentine, 2000). After trauma, a person with PTSD recovers more quickly with strong social support. Unfortunately, with ongoing PTSD, that social support tends to diminish as the symptoms of PTSD take their toll on relationships (Kaniasty & Norris, 2008).By recognizing the importance of the larger social network to PTSD, psychologists can begin to develop more effective preventions and interventions that take the entire social system into account, not just the individual with PTSD symptoms.

Biological explanations for PTSD focus on the hippocampus, a structure that has been discussed previously in the context of the biology of memory formation. Brain imaging studies consistently show that PTSD is correlated with smaller hippocampal volume (Bossini et al., 2008;  Bremner et al., 2002). This leaves us with two competing hypotheses: Are people with a naturally smaller hippocampus more vulnerable to PTSD? Or is there something about the experience of trauma that is toxic to the hippocampus? Both hypotheses seem reasonable. As we observed in Chapter 7, stress increases the release of cortisol, which in turn might have toxic effects on the hippocampus (Sapolsky, Krey, & McEwen, 1985). In Vietnam veterans with PTSD, decreases in hippocampal volume are greater as a function of the amount of time that has elapsed since a traumatic event, suggesting that hippocampal damage can continue steadily because of the disorder (Chao, Yaffe, Samuelson, & Neylan, 2014). Comparisons of twins have also identified PTSD-related damage to the anterior cingulate cortex (Kasai et al., 2008).PTSD is correlated with lower levels of naturally occurring benzodiazepine activity in the frontal cortex (Geuze et al., 2008) (see Figure 14.20). Extra benzodiazepines can be administered in the form of major tranquilizers, such as Valium, which produce relaxation and lack of anxiety. If naturally occurring benzodiazepine activity was low, anxiety would be the logical result. Lower levels of natural benzodiazepine activity might also explain the unfortunate tendency for people to self-medicate for PTSD with alcohol (Jakupcak et al., 2010). Alcohol reduces anxiety using biological mechanisms similar to those of the benzodiazepines.Yellow areas show reduced binding of benzodiazepine, which has a tranquilizing effect, in the brains of combat veterans with PTSD compared to those of combat veterans who do not have PTSD.These biological correlates form a pattern of dysregulation of circuits that allow us to process information within its proper context (Liberzon & Abelson, 2016). For example, seeing a mountain lion in your backyard should evoke a very different response than viewing a mountain lion safely within its compound at a zoo. This basic use of contextual information allows us to behave appropriately (whether it is to enjoy the view or act defensively). If the networks that help us connect context to behavioral and emotional responses become disrupted, we might see danger in realistically safe situations.

Learning, and classical conditioning in particular, contribute to the symptoms of PTSD. Individuals with PTSD show conditioned responses to stimuli associated with the traumatic event. Combat veterans with PTSD seem particularly sensitive to smells such as burning rubber and diesel (Rothbaum, Rizzo, & Difede, 2010). Individuals with PTSD show increased generalization to conditioned fear stimuli, suggesting that over time, they will become responsive to more stimuli, not less (Kaczkurkin et al., 2016).

Social and cultural factors play significant roles in the development of PTSD. People reporting low social support in the 6 months before 9/11 were twice as likely to be diagnosed with PTSD as people who reported strong social support during this period (Galea et al., 2002). Cultural factors also influence the likelihood of PTSD. Following 9/11, PTSD was more common in New York City residents of some ethnicities than others, affecting 13.4% of Hispanics, 9.3% of Black Americans, 6.5% of White Americans, and 3.2% of Asian Americans (Galea et al., 2002).

        A disorder characterized by disruptions in a person’s identity, memory, or consciousness
        
    
 feature disruptions in a person’s identity, memory, or consciousness (APA, 2013).Dissociative disorders take several forms. Dissociative amnesia occurs when a person forgets important information about specific events, often following a frightening or traumatic event. In dissociative fugue, people become confused over their identity and often combine this loss of identity with sudden travel and the assumption of a new identity. These situations typically last a few hours or days, but not longer periods of time (Kopelman, 2002).Heisman Trophy winner, NFL star, and mixed martial arts fighter Herschel Walker has spoken about his experience with dissociative identity disorder to encourage military veterans to seek help for psychological disorders.Depersonalization or derealization disorder occurs when a person experiences strong feelings of unreality about either the self or the surrounding environment (APA, 2013). People might feel as though they are watching their behavior from outside their bodies or that the world is dreamlike. However, they retain their ability to understand that their feelings are not realistic. In other words, they feel as if they’re outside their bodies, but they don’t believe that this is really happening.Possibly the most controversial of the dissociative disorders is dissociative identity disorder, which was previously known as multiple personality disorder. According to the DSM-5, dissociative identity disorder is characterized by the experience of two distinct personality states (APA, 2013).Dissociative identity disorder experienced a spike in popularity as a diagnosis in the mid-1990s but has since dropped in frequency. Media attention might have contributed to the frequency with which this disorder was diagnosed. Before the popularization of patients named Sybil and Eve in books and films, few cases of dissociative identity disorder had ever been described in the scientific literature. Following this media interest, thousands of cases were diagnosed, primarily in the United States and Canada. Responses to extreme stress frequently include detachment, numbness, or altered memory and cognition, but this is quite different from the development of additional identities. Well-meaning therapists can misinterpret these stress symptoms as dissociative identity disorder and, worse yet, suggest this possibility to their clients. People diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder, like those with other dissociative disorders, score very high on tests of suggestibility that predict a person’s susceptibility to hypnosis, as well as in measures of being likely to fantasize (Giesbrecht, Lynn, Lilienfeld, & Merckelbach, 2010). These findings imply that these people may have difficulty distinguishing between reality and fantasy and might accept a therapist’s suggestion without considering it critically.

 involved physical symptoms that do not have an underlying medical cause (APA, 2013). The DSM-5 notes that these patients spend excessive amounts of time thinking about the seriousness of their symptoms, which is accompanied by a high level of anxiety. To the patient, the somatic symptoms appear quite serious and often disabling. Among the different symptoms are vague pain complaints, gastrointestinal upset, sexual problems, amnesia, breathing problems, or unexplained sensory or motor problems. People with somatic symptoms usually visit physicians frequently, report high numbers of physical complaints, and are at risk of becoming dependent on pain medication. They can become preoccupied with their health and often insist on unnecessary medical tests and procedures.

 is characterized by impairments in identity, in personality traits, and in establishment of empathy or intimacy. Personality disorders cannot be diagnosed in people under the age of 18. To illustrate this category of disorders, we will now look at three personality disorders in greater detail: antisocial personality disorder (ASPD), borderline personality disorder, and narcissistic personality disorder.Anders Behring Breivik killed 8 people with a bomb before shooting another 69 people at a nearby youth camp on July 22, 2011. Police told reporters that during a reenactment of the shootings, Breivik didn’t show any remorse. Although we don’t know whether Breivik could be diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder, a callous lack of empathy and remorse is typical of people with this diagnosis.

Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD)Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD)A disorder characterized by an unusual lack of remorse, empathy, or regard for normal social rules and conventions.
    
        Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD)
        A disorder characterized by an unusual lack of remorse, empathy, or regard for normal social rules and conventions.
        
    
 is characterized by a pervasive pattern of disregard for and violation of the rights of others (APA, 2013, p. 659). Individuals with this disorder have little regard for normal social rules and conventions. Their behavior is frequently risky and irresponsible, and they form shallow, fleeting relationships with others.ASPD is quite similar to the term psychopath, which has not been used by the DSM system since its third edition was published in 1980. Criteria for ASPD in DSM-III and DSM-IV focused on a person’s behaviors, especially criminal behaviors, whereas the term psychopath implies flaws in the person’s consistent traits or character (Hare, 2006). Between 0.2% and 3.3% of the population experiences ASPD in a given year (APA, 2013).  Hare (2006) has estimated the number of psychopaths in the United States to be approximately 1%.Most individuals with ASPD or psychopathy do not engage in outright criminal behavior, and not all criminals have ASPD or psychopathy. Noncriminal individuals with ASPD were easily recruited by placing a newspaper ad calling for charming, aggressive, carefree people who are impulsively irresponsible but are good at handling people and at looking after number one (Widom, 1978, p. 72).Research on individuals with antisocial parents suggests a genetic contribution to this disorder. Related traits such as fearless dominance, impulsive antisociality, and callousness show substantial heritability rates between .46 and .67 (Blair, Colledge, Murray, & Mitchell, 2001). Children adopted at birth who have antisocial biological parents are more likely to engage in antisocial behavior (Cadoret & Cain, 1981). When children of biological parents who are not antisocial are adopted by antisocial parents, they are less likely than children with biological parents who are antisocial to engage in antisocial behavior (Mednick & Kandel, 1988). As mentioned previously in this textbook, child maltreatment interacts with a genetic predisposition to violent antisocial behavior (Caspi et al., 2003).A genetic influence on a trait usually implies that the trait provides some advantage, but how can this be the case for a tendency toward antisocial behavior? One suggestion is that fearlessness characterizes both heroes and people with antisocial behavior (Lykken, 1982). Having heroic people in your population might offset the negative impact of having some antisocial people. To test his hypothesis about the similarities between these two groups, Lykken devised an Activity Preference Questionnaire, which asks respondents to choose between a frightening or embarrassing situation and one that is simply unpleasant. For example, would you prefer to wash a car or drive a car 95 miles per hour? People who either engage in antisocial behavior or who have behaved heroically typically choose the risky alternative (driving fast) over a chore (washing car), whereas cautious people typically choose the chore over the risky alternative.The areas marked in blue showed less activity in criminal psychopaths than in noncriminal control participants in a study during the processing of negative emotional words like rape or torture. These areas are associated with emotional processing and include (a) the cingulate cortex and basal ganglia and (b) the hippocampus and amygdala. The failure of negative emotional stimuli to produce normal levels of arousal might allow the psychopath to engage in harmful behaviors without experiencing normal remorse or empathy.A relative lack of response to emotions, especially those of others, might also contribute to antisocial behavior disorder. While undergoing brain imaging, people with ASPD, unlike the control participants in a study, showed little activation of parts of the brain that are usually active during emotional processing when listening to words such as torture, rape, or cancer (Hare, 2006;  Kiehl et al., 2001). Participants also were shown neutral scenes and rather gruesome images of murder scenes. Again, the people with ASPD showed different patterns of brain activation than did the typical control participants. In particular, the amygdalae of people with ASPD showed relatively little activity. As discussed in Chapters 4 and 7, the amygdala normally participates in the recognition of fear and other negative emotions in others. Other research indicates that children with antisocial tendencies are impaired in their ability to identify expressions of sadness and fear in others, a finding consistent with lower activity in the amygdala (Blair et al., 2001).Antisocial behavior is associated with abnormalities of the orbitofrontal cortex. Orbitofrontal abnormalities occur at higher rates among murderers and those diagnosed with ASPD (Davidson, Putnam, & Larson, 2000). As observed in Chapter 4, damage to the frontal areas of the cortex often leads to poor judgment and impulsivity. In one representative case, two adults who had been raised in stable, middle-class homes but who had experienced damage to the orbitofrontal cortex in infancy both showed a profound inability to understand the consequences of their negative behavior (Anderson, Bechara, Damasio, Tranel, & Damasio, 1999). They engaged in stealing, lying, and aggressive behavior and were poor parents.At a 2002 Convention of Law Enforcement Officers in Canada, psychologist Robert Hare made a startling suggestion (Hare, 2002). With slides in the background depicting convicted WorldCom chief executive officer Bernard Ebbers and Enron chief financial officer Andrew Fastow, Hare asked his audience why law enforcement personnel are screened for psychopathy, but not executives responsible for millions of dollars of people’s savings and retirement funds.When we hear the term psychopath, most of us think of characters like Hannibal Lecter from The Silence of the Lambs. However, Hare and other psychologists suggest that psychopaths are more likely to be the people next door, your coworkers, and maybe even your friends and relatives. Not only are psychopaths relatively common (around 1% of the population), but their characteristics also might allow them to be disturbingly successful. When profiles of 39 top British executives were compared to those of criminals and psychiatric patients, the executives were found to be more charming, egotistical, manipulative, and lacking in empathy (Board & Fritzon, 2005). Consequently, researchers began to refer to the executives as successful psychopaths, whereas the criminals and patients were unsuccessful psychopaths. Hare and his colleague, Paul Babiak, would agree. Using scales that they hope to market to corporations wishing to avoid hiring the next Fastow, these researchers have shown that corporate psychopaths score very high on items measuring the callous, selfless, and remorseless use of others (Babiak & Hare, 2006). Unlike criminal psychopaths, however, the corporate psychopaths did not show patterns of instability and social deviance.Unfortunately, rapid and uncertain change in the business environment may provide fertile ground for corporate psychopaths to rise to the top. In a world of downsizing, an executive like Sunbeam’s Chainsaw Al Dunlap, who fired half the corporation’s workforce, might look like the right person for the job. But Dunlap also had been divorced by his first wife for extreme cruelty, thrown a chair at one of his executives, allegedly altered Sunbeam’s financial records to make his performance look better, and demanded additional severance pay when he was fired for cause.Bernie Madoff built one of the most successful businesses on Wall Street and served as the nonexecutive chairman of the NASDAQ stock market before being convicted of perpetrating one of the largest financial frauds in U.S. history. Psychologists Paul Babiak and Robert Hare suggest that it might be difficult to distinguish between tough corporate leaders and those with antisocial tendencies.Modern corporations often find it difficult to distinguish between the behavior of the corporate psychopath and the person who is a genuinely visionary leader. Leaders such as Bill Gates may seem insensitive to others’ feelings, according to leadership experts, but they turn their grandiosity toward making their organizations great rather than plundering them for personal gain (Maccoby, 2003).

The term borderline personality disorder (BPD)borderline personality disorder (BPD)A disorder characterized by instability in interpersonal relationships, self- image, and emotion
    
        borderline personality disorder (BPD)
        A disorder characterized by instability in interpersonal relationships, self- image, and emotion
        
    
 originated from the idea that the characteristics of this disorder fell on the border between anxiety and psychosis.According to the DSM-5, BPD is characterized by instability in interpersonal relationships, self-image, and emotion. Individuals with this disorder may engage in frantic efforts to avoid abandonment, either real or imagined, and may behave in impulsive, self-destructive ways (see Figure 14.21). Suicide and self-mutilating behaviors, which were discussed in Chapter 8, are quite common among people with this disorder. Relationships are often initially intense and idealized, but if the individual perceives any slight rejection, love can turn to anger quickly.Not only do people with borderline personality disorder perform differently than healthy controls in experimental activities measuring trust, but their brain activity during a trust game is also different. In healthy study participants, activity in the anterior insula decreases when an offer is higher or fairer. In the participants with borderline personality disorder, insula activity did not correspond well with the offers that they received. This inability to respond to trust normally might explain some difficulties these people experience in building healthy relationships with others.Borderline personality disorder affects about 2% of the population, with women outnumbering men by a factor of 3 to 1 (Skodol & Bender, 2003). People with BPD appear to be vulnerable to a number of additional disorders, including bipolar disorder, substance abuse, eating disorders, and other personality disorders.Borderline personality disorder is five times more common among close relatives with the disorder than among the general population, suggesting a biological predisposition (APA, 2013). However, as many as 70% of individuals with this diagnosis have histories of abandonment, neglect, and physical or sexual abuse, or both types of abuse (Hunt, 2007). These findings suggest that traumatic experiences interact with a possible genetic predisposition to produce disordered behavior.DisorderSymptomsPossible Causal Factors Under InvestigationPhobiaExcessive fear of an object or situationExaggeration of normal cautionClassical conditioningCognitions about fear stimulusCollectivist cultures emphasizing shamePanic disorderRepeated panic attacks, accompanied by excessive worry about having more panic attacksPossible abnormality in orexin functionCognitions regarding symptomsExpectations and embarrassmentCultural influencesGeneralized anxiety disorder (GAD)Excessive anxiety for six months that is not correlated with specific objects or situationsGenetic predispositionStressFearful schemasLow socioeconomic statusDisruptions in social connectivityObsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)Intrusive, repetitious, and anxiety-producing thoughts and behaviorsGenetic predispositionLow serotonin activityPrefrontal and basal ganglia activityExtension of grooming and territorial behaviorsRewarding aspects of compulsionsExtension of cultural ritualsBody dysmorphic disorderUnrealistic perception of physical flawsGenetic predispositionSuperior perception of facial distortionsPosttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)Exposure to a traumatic event, followed by flashbacks, hypervigilance, and nightmaresHippocampus and prefrontal cortexBenzodiazepine receptorsClassical conditioningSocial support

As defined by the DSM-5, narcissistic personality disorder (NPD)narcissistic personality disorder (NPD)A disorder characterized by grandiosity, need for admiration, and low empathy
    
        narcissistic personality disorder (NPD)
        A disorder characterized by grandiosity, need for admiration, and low empathy
        
    
 is characterized by grandiosity, need for admiration, and lack of empathy (APA, 2013). Renewed interest in NPD has occurred in part due to questions about possible intersections between narcissism and social media use (McCain & Campbell, 2016). Other psychologists are tracking narcissistic traits as a function of age, with younger individuals showing more narcissism than older adults (Twenge & Campbell, 2009).Narcissistic personality disorder combines grandiosity, need for attention, and low empathy. The social media phenomenon of the selfie is the perfect outlet for people with narcissistic tendencies (Weiser, 2015).Although the DSM-5 has only one category for NPD, psychologists continue to debate the relationship between two apparent subtypes—the grandiose narcissist and the vulnerable narcissist (Miller et al., 2011;  Miller, Lynam, Hyatt, & Campbell, 2017). The grandiose narcissist tends to show inflated views of self-worth, aggressiveness, and dominance, while the vulnerable narcissist combines inflated views of self-worth with insecurity, defensiveness, and negative emotions. According to Miller et al. (2011, 2017), the DSM emphasizes the grandiose version, which might result in clinicians being less aware of the vulnerable version among their clients. One possible solution is to use trait models like the Big Five traits, described in Chapter 12, to distinguish between the two patterns. For example, the grandiose narcissist is extroverted, while the vulnerable narcissist is shy and neurotic.We are not certain how narcissistic behavior develops. The personality disorder itself is not to be diagnosed officially until adulthood, but the roots of narcissism might be found in the development of self-esteem strategies in the child (Thomaes, Bushman, De Castro, & Stegge, 2009). As such, narcissism might be simply an extreme version of the impression management and search for esteem that are considered normal in children and teens.Narcissistic traits have been shown to be somewhat heritable, and they possibly have their beginnings in basic temperament (Thomaes et al., 2009). Chapter 12 discussed reactivity, or a child’s tendency to either approach or avoid a stimulus. The pattern of behavior seen in the grandiose narcissist is consistent with approach, while the vulnerable narcissist seems to show both approach and avoidant tendencies. As discussed in Chapter 12, temperament quickly interacts with environmental factors, particularly those in the surrounding social setting. Parents who overpraise their children might produce habituation to praise, leading a child to seek constantly higher levels of positive feedback. Cold parents with very high expectations for their children might also stimulate narcissistic behaviors as children attempt to protect themselves while craving positive feedback from others as compensation.As you have Read in this Chapter, narcissism is characterized by grandiosity, entitlement, and low empathy. While this doesn’t sound very attractive, people who score high in narcissistic traits are also likely to score high on measures of creativity, happiness, and self-esteem, while scoring low on measures of anxiety and depression (Konrath, Meier, & Bushman, 2014).Measuring narcissism is difficult because of the possible dual nature of this trait. In addition to the grandiose behaviors, many individuals show a vulnerable, hypersensitive quality, which makes them shy and fragile in the face of criticism. As a result, the many self-report scales for measuring narcissism do not always agree well with one another. What we present here are two short scales of narcissism, the Hypersensitive Narcissism Scale (Hendin & Cheek, 1997) and the Single-Item Narcissism Scale (Konrath et al., 2014). As you complete the scales, your results are more likely to be meaningful to you if you answer the items as honestly as possible (attempting to avoid social desirability effects). See if the two scales provide you with consistent results. Do you think these scales are valid?Place a check in the appropriate box, and then add your scores for the 10 items.Very uncharacteristic or untrue; strongly disagree1234Very characteristic or true; strongly agree5I can become entirely absorbed in thinking about my personal affairs, my health, my cares, or my relations to others.My feelings are easily hurt by ridicule or by the slighting remarks of others.When I enter a room, I often become self-conscious and feel that the eyes of others are upon me.I dislike sharing the credit of an achievement with others.I am appreciated by at least one of those present.I feel that I am temperamentally different from most people.I often interpret the remarks of others in a personal way.I easily become wrapped up in my own interests and forget the existence of others.I feel that I have enough on my hands without worrying about other people’s troubles.I am secretly put out when other people come to me with their troubles, asking me for my time and sympathy.Add up all your scores. The totals can range from 5 to 50. There are no right or wrong answers on these types of scales, nor do we have a cutoff value that absolutely determines a person’s status as a narcissist. The mean reported for college students is generally about 29.To what extent do you agree with this statement: I am a narcissist. (Note: The word narcissist means an egotistical, self-focused, and vain person.)1234567Not very true of me     Very true of meUnderstanding the roots of narcissistic behavior will help clinicians develop more effective interventions, which will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 15 on treatments. In the meantime, you have the opportunity to assess yourself for narcissism using several standardized instruments.In Previous Chapters, we have explored many factors that might contribute to someone’s participating in cyberbullying another person. In this chapter, we reflect on the role of psychological disorder in producing this behavior. Our general definition of abnormal behavior includes harm to others, and cyberbullying certainly fits that criterion.Research on traditional, face-to-face bullying has implicated traits known as the Dark Triad of Machiavellianism, narcissism, and psychopathy (Paulhus & Williams, 2002). Narcissism and psychopathy already have been described in detail in this chapter; Machiavellianism refers to coldness, dishonesty, and calculated manipulation to achieve a person’s goals. More recently, scientists have argued for adding a fourth trait, sadism, to the Dark Triad (van Geel, Goemans, Toprak, & Vedder, 2017). Sadism refers to the tendency to take pleasure in the suffering of others, and it is uniquely correlated with many types of antisocial behavior. This trait can be assessed using the Varieties of Sadistic Tendencies Scale (VAST;  Paulhus, Jones, Boyle, Saklofske, & Matthews, 2015).In a large sample of older teens and young adults, Machiavellianism, psychopathy, and sadism were related to traditional bullying, but only sadism was related to cyberbullying (van Geel et al., 2017). This suggests that looking for elements of psychopathology associated with traditional bullying to predict likely cyberbullies might not be fruitful. Assessing sadism, however, should not only identify individuals prone to cyberbullying, but to antisocial behaviors in general.The Dark Triad characteristics of Machiavellianism, narcissism, and psychopathy commonly occur together and are predictive of traditional, but not cyberbullying. We apparently do a pretty good job of detecting Dark Triad traits in other people simply by viewing their appearance (Holtzman, 2011). This might help you identify people who might engage in traditional bullying, but not necessarily those prone to cyberbullying. A fourth potential Dark trait—sadism—is more predictive of cyberbullying behavior.

Be sure that you can define these terms and use them correctly.
