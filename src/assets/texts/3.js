Environmental factors such as stress, diet, smoking, and exercise can influence whether a gene is turned on or off. We all know that identical twins, like the little girls appearing in the photo, are, well, identical. Or are they?For a long time, scientists were puzzled not by the similarities between identical twins, but by their differences. If two people share the same deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), as identical twins do, why does one get cancer while the other stays healthy? Why does one become obese while the other remains fit?When science began to unravel some mysteries about genes and how they work, answers to these questions emerged. You have the same DNA in each cell of your body, yet some cells develop into heart cells, others into brain cells, and so on. How does the same set of DNA know how to make these different types of cells? Genes, or segments of DNA that produce specific proteins, can be turned on and off. The genes that are not turned off are free to produce the proteins needed to build a particular kind of cell, whether that is a skin cell or a liver cell. Only about 10% to 20% of the genes in a particular type of cell, such as a skin cell or brain cell, are active. Genes do not just turn on and off as they build a body during development. Your ongoing interactions with the environment can also turn genes on or off. What you eat, whether you smoke or drink, your stress levels, and other environmental factors can influence how your DNA works. Our understanding of these ongoing interactions between genes and the environment is the reason psychologists no longer argue about the separate contributions of nature and nurture. In this chapter, we will explore these interactions in more detail. Let’s zoom in to see what’s happening when the environment interacts with DNA. In mice, a gene called Agouti produces yellow fur and obesity when it is turned on, but brown fur and normal weight when it is turned off (Dolinoy, Huang, & Jirtle, 2007). Certain environmental factors can turn the gene on or off. When pregnant mother mice ate food containing bisphenol A (BPA), a chemical found in food and beverage containers, baby bottles, dental sealants, and food cans, their babies had yellow fur and were obese. The BPA turned on the Agouti gene. When pregnant mice are fed a diet containing BPA, found in plastics and other consumer products, their offspring are more likely to have yellow fur and to be obese. How does studying the fur color of mice help us understand the differences between identical human twins? The young twins on the previous page have a great deal in common, but as they get older, they are more likely to eat different foods and have different experiences. These environmental influences can change the way their genes are turned on or off, just as the BPA affected the Agouti gene in the mice. These changes accumulate over time, so identical twins become less similar as they age. In this chapter, we will explore how nature and nurture interact to build the mind across the life span, and how the interactions between nature and nurture have been shaping the human mind over millennia.

Along with an understanding of the structures and processes of the brain, covered in Chapter 4, knowing how our biological history shapes our behavior is an important part of understanding the mind. Contemporary psychologists view the contributions of naturenatureThe contributions of heredity to our physical structure and behaviors.

 (the results of our experience with the environment) as being closely intertwined, as opposed to somehow competing for control over structure and behavior. These identical twins probably do not look as similar as they did as small children. The twin on the left is a nonsmoker, while her sister on the right smoked for 29 years. Scholars have not always thought about nature and nurture the way we do today. Instead of viewing the actions of nature and nurture as inseparable, earlier scholars talked in terms of nature versus nurture and debated the relative contributions of nature or nurture to a particular type of behavior. Credit for describing the contrast between heredity and environment as  nature versus nurture usually goes to Francis Galton (1869), who was Charles Darwin’s cousin. Galton believed that intelligence was largely the result of inheritance, a topic tackled in Chapter 10. Over the next 150 years or so, many thinkers engaged in a highly spirited debate on this question. As Chapter 10 will demonstrate, contemporary psychologists view intelligence as another example of an outcome shaped by both genetic inheritance and environment. Francis Galton was the first to use the phrase  nature versus nurture. We can say with some certainty that the either/or approach to human behavior has produced some of the most contentious discussions in the history of psychology. Our motive for arguing in favor of the intertwined approach to nature and nurture is intended not to sidestep difficult questions, but rather to support good science. By zooming out to integrate a number of perspectives, both biological and experiential, we can achieve a more accurate understanding of these questions.

Before we explore the interactions between nature and nurture that contribute to psychological phenomena, let’s look at the genetic mechanisms that help shape the mind. Every nucleus in the approximately 37 trillion cells of your body, with the exception of your red blood cells and sperm or eggs, contains two complete copies of the human genome, a set of instructions for building a human. Your personal set of instructions is known as a genotypegenotypeAn individual’s profile of alleles

. Some genes have a large number of alleles. Of the more than 500 alleles for the BRCA1 (Breast Cancer 1) gene, a small number are associated with a higher risk for breast and other cancers. Actress Angelina Jolie, who possesses the high-risk alleles, chose to undergo a preventive mastectomy to reduce her chances of developing breast cancer. One half of your genotype was provided by your mother’s egg, and the other half was provided by your father’s sperm. Each parent contributes a set of 23 chromosomes, which in turn are composed of many molecules of DNA.

 occurs when these genetic instructions are used to produce a particular protein. Each cell contains the instructions for an entire human organism, but only a subset of instructions is expressed at any given time and location. Gene expression in a nerve cell is different from gene expression in a muscle cell or a skin cell. Twenty-three pairs of chromosomes make up the human genome.

, can give rise to different phenotypical traits. Many alleles can occur for a given gene, but an individual receives only two—one from each parent. For example, alleles for blood type include A, B, and O, but typically, nobody has all three. As shown in Figure 3.1, combinations of your two alleles make your blood Type A (AA or AO), Type B (BB or BO), Type AB (AB), or Type O (OO). The three possible blood type alleles—A, B, and O—can be combined to produce Type A, Type B, Type O, or Type AB blood. If both parents contribute the same type of allele, such as a version of the MC1R gene related to having freckles, the child would be considered homozygoushomozygousHaving two of the same alleles for a gene.

 alleles determine a phenotype in either the homozygous or the heterozygous condition. Because alleles for no freckles are recessive and alleles for freckles are dominant, the typical way that an individual has no freckles is if that person receives two copies of the no-freckle allele, one from each parent. Any individual receiving either two freckle alleles or one freckle allele and one no-freckle allele will have freckles (see Figure 3.2). Having freckles (F) is dominant, whereas having no freckles (f) is recessive. The only way that a child can have no freckles is to inherit two of the recessive  no freckle alleles, one from each parent. In this example, both parents are heterozygous (Ff) with freckles. DNA belonging to different individuals can be compared using autoradiographs formed by labeling DNA fragments with a radioactive marker and then exposing the DNA to x-ray film. In this case, we are looking at a simple paternity test (Public Broadcasting Service, 1998). DNA samples have been taken from three people: a mother, her child, and the possible father of the child. The two letters for each segment represent the individual’s genotype. For example, in the first autoradiograph, the mother is an AD, the child is an AC, and the possible father is a BC. Use the autoradiographs to complete Table 3.1.1 (A, B, C, D)2 (E, F, G)3 (H, I, J, K)4 (L, M, N, O)MotherGGChildACMOPossible fatherHKTo evaluate the likelihood of the possible father’s paternity, identify which letters the child inherited from the mother and which from the father. The child will receive one allele from each parent, so the child’s combinations of alleles must be possible based on the mother’s and father’s genotypes. Overall, is it possible for this man to have fathered this child?As with any hypothesis, genetic tests never prove a relationship: They can only disprove one. Based on the evidence in this case, we cannot prove the hypothesis that this man is the child’s biological parent. All we could do is show that he is not the father. If the child had an AD genotype instead of an AC genotype in the first box, this man could not possibly be the father because he could not supply either the A or the D allele. Such an exclusion result is considered absolute evidence of nonpaternity. In contrast, the results of this test suggest that it is very likely that this man is the biological parent of the child. Whether you have freckles or not is a simple example of how dominant and recessive genes interact, but one allele does not always dominate another. In a study of gene–environment interactions involving the serotonin transporter gene (SERT) and a child’s response to bullying, the authors note that with two types of alleles (S for short or L for long), individuals could have one of three genotypes: SS, SL, or LL (Sugden et al., 2010). Neither the S nor the L allele dominates the other. As you can see in Figure 3.3, The SL group had levels of emotional disturbance in response to frequent bullying that fell between the extremes of the SS and the LL groups (Sugden et al., 2010). If either the S or the L alleles were dominant, the SL group would behave like that dominant group instead. Neither the S nor the L allele of the serotonin transporter gene dominates the other. Among children who have been bullied frequently, those with the SL genotype (shown in green) experience a level of emotional problems midway between the levels of those with the SS and LL genotypes. If either the S or the L allele was dominant, we would expect the SL group to behave the same way as the homozygous dominant group. Given that each parent can pass along more than 8 million combinations of chromosomes, it might be surprising that family resemblance can be so strong, as it is in actors and brothers Liam (left) and Chris (right) Hemsworth.

If you have siblings, you are aware that having the same biological parents does not guarantee similar appearance, personality, and behavior. The development of an egg or sperm cell is like shuffling a deck of cards. In both cases, a large number of possible outcomes may occur. When a parent’s cell divides to make an egg or a sperm cell, each resulting cell contains 23 chromosomes, one chromosome from each of the parent’s original 23 chromosome pairs. As a result, a single human can produce eggs or sperm with (8,388,608) combinations of chromosomes. Add this variability to the different possibilities provided by the other parent, and it may seem surprising that we resemble our relatives as much as we do.

Despite this potential variability, we remain similar to our genetic relatives. This important point will be revisited later in the chapter, when the evolution of social behavior is discussed. RelatednessRelatednessThe probability that two people share the same allele from a common ancestor
    
        Relatedness

 is defined as the probability that two people share copies of the same allele from a common ancestor. If we go back in history far enough, we all share common ancestors. Relatedness, however, is usually computed within a limited number of generations. The chance that you share an allele with one of your parents is one-half, as is the chance that you share an allele with a sibling. First cousins have a one-eighth likelihood of sharing an allele (see Figure 3.4). These types of calculations led geneticist J. B. S. Haldane to allegedly proclaim,  I would lay down my life for two brothers or eight cousins! (Bynum & Porter, 2005, p. 261). Haldane was computing the likelihood that his genes would be passed down to future generations. As discussed later in the chapter, evolutionary psychologists suggest that sacrificing yourself for others is more likely when the others are genetically related relatives. Relatedness refers to the probability that two people share a particular allele from a common ancestor. The chance that you share an allele with one of your parents or a brother or sister is 0.50, or one-half. The chance that you share an allele with a niece or nephew is 0.25, or one-quarter.

Of the 23 pairs of human chromosomes from each parent, 22 pairs are perfectly matched. In other words, a gene appearing on one of a pair of chromosomes (perhaps a gene for blood type) has a corresponding gene on its partner. In contrast, the X and Y chromosomes do not carry the same genes. The much-larger X chromosome contains about 2,000 active genes, while the Y has fewer than 100. Females carry two copies of the X chromosome, whereas males carry one X and one Y chromosome. X chromosomeY chromosomeThe allele responsible for hemophilia, a disease characterized by the failure of blood to clot, is found only on the X chromosome. This allele is recessive, leading to different outcomes based on the sex of the child receiving the alleles. If a female receives a healthy allele on the X chromosome from one parent and a disease-causing allele on the X chromosome from her other parent, she will be a carrier for the condition but not experience it. In contrast, a male receiving a disease-causing allele on the X chromosome from his mother will have the condition. Because there is no equivalent allele on the Y chromosome to offset the disease-causing recessive allele, the disease-causing allele will be expressed. As a result, conditions such as hemophilia are more frequent among males and are called sex-linked characteristics (see Figure 3.5). As illustrated in Figure 3.6, the family of Queen Victoria of Great Britain (1819–1901) spread hemophilia to a number of European royal houses. If a daughter inherits her mother’s X chromosome containing the allele for hemophilia, she will be a carrier but will not have the disease. If a son inherits this chromosome, he will have the disease. Unlike his sister, he does not have a healthy X chromosome to offset the disease allele. Queen Victoria of Great Britain (1819–1901) had nine children. One son (Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany) had hemophilia, and two daughters (Princess Alice and Princess Beatrice) were carriers for the condition. As a result of their marriages to other European royalty, the three children spread the hemophilia gene to the royal families of Germany, Russia, and Spain. Therefore, hemophilia was once popularly called  the royal disease. Even when genes are duplicated on the X and Y chromosomes, they can perform very differently depending on their location. Forensic experts determine the sex of the source of a genetic sample by observing the amelogenin gene, which contributes to the development of tooth enamel (Akane, 1998). The size of the amelogenin gene on the X chromosome is different than on the Y chromosome. Differences between genes for immune system function located on the sex chromosomes might explain the higher risks associated with organ transplants in which the gender of the donor and recipient do not match (Ge, Huang, Yuan, Zhou, & Gong, 2012).

Our species shares quite a few genes with chimpanzees, mice, fruit flies, yeast, and a weed known as thale cress (see Figure 3.7). At the same time, humans have genes that definitely set them apart from other animals (and plants). For example, research points to differences between humans and chimpanzees in a single gene, FoxP2, which appears to have had a significant effect on distinctly human behaviors, including spoken language (Konopka et al., 2009). Humans share quite a few genes with other species, such as the 18% of genes that we share with a weed known as thale cress. However, geneticists are most interested in the genes that differ from those of other species, such as the FoxP2 gene, which appears to be responsible for spoken language. Mutations of this gene cause severe speech and language disorders. Table 3.2 compares several subfields of genetics that are relevant to our understanding of behavior and mental processes. Behavioral geneticists attempt to discover the strength of genetic influences on a particular behavior. Molecular geneticists look for candidate genes, or genes that have a greater impact on a trait of interest than other genes. Functional geneticists study the entire genome, looking for whole patterns of genetic differences linked to a given trait. Finally, geneticists studying gene–environment interactions look for situations in which candidate genes appear to have different effects.

 is the statistical likelihood that variations observed across individuals in a population are due to genetics. If genes play no part in producing phenotypical differences among individuals, heritability is zero. For example, genes are responsible for human hearts, but there is no individual variation in the population in terms of the presence of a heart—each of us has one. Consequently, the heritability of having a heart is zero. If genes are totally responsible for all phenotypical differences among individuals, heritability is 1.0. For example, all variation in the population in terms of having or not having a fatal neurological condition known as Huntington’s disease is entirely because of genetics. If you inherit a Huntington’s gene from one parent, you will develop the condition. Heritability of most human traits is typically in the range of 0.30 to 0.60. Heritability is a concept that is frequently misunderstood. It always refers to populations, never to individuals. Saying that a trait such as shyness is 40% heritable does not say that 40% of one individual’s shyness is produced by genes and the other 60% by his or her environment. Instead, this suggests that the variations in shyness that we see across the population (some people are shy and others are not) are the result of both genetic and environmental factors (see Figure 3.8). Heritability rates tell us how much of the variability seen in a population can be because of genetics. According to these data, we can say that genes have a greater influence on autism spectrum disorder than on reading disabilities. Heritability cannot be assessed without taking the environment into account, which is another source of potential confusion. If the environment is held constant (i.e., everybody is treated the same way), the heritability of a trait will appear to be high. For example, if you plant seeds in trays with identical nutrients, water, and sunlight, the height of the resulting plants will reflect their genetic differences. In variable environments, heritability is lower. If you plant seeds in trays receiving different amounts of nutrients, water, and sunlight, the height of the resulting plants will appear to be less influenced by genetics. If you studied the heritability of human intelligence in participants living in extremely wealthy or extremely poor circumstances, genetic influences would be exaggerated, just as they are when you hold the nutrients, water, and sunlight constant for your plants. Researchers assessing the heritability of human traits attempt to do so within a typical range of environments. Genetic Research often pushes the boundaries of research ethics, discussed in Chapter 2. Conclusions from genetic research can apply to entire groups of people, far beyond the individuals who agreed to participate. Even when individual participants are protected, the possibility that data could stigmatize an entire group should be considered and avoided. For example, most anthropologists argue that the political concept of  race is not clearly defined at the genetic level. Individuals of European and Asian backgrounds, but not individuals from sub-Saharan backgrounds, usually trace 1% to 4% of their DNA back to non–Homo sapiens ancestors, such as Neanderthals or Denisovans. This type of finding could be misinterpreted by the public as representing an important racial divide, an idea that has been soundly rejected by geneticists (Yudell, Roberts, DeSalle, & Tishkoff, 2016). Many indigenous groups have been reluctant to participate in genetics research. The possibility of promoting social prejudices due to stigmatization is a common source of concern, along with cultural values that are inconsistent with genetics methods. Many studies require storage of biological samples in biorepositories. This practice might be inconsistent with cultural values. For example, the Maori people of New Zealand view tissue samples, DNA, and any associated data as taonga ( precious) and tapu ( sacred). To engage the Maori in genetics research, researchers developed a culturally sensitive plan that tailored informed consent, control over the procedures and data, and community engagement to existing Maori values (Beaton et al., 2017). Although the model was developed for use with Maori participants, it provides guidance for researchers setting up biorepositories with many types of communities. Using culturally sensitive procedures for handling biosamples collected for genetics research built trust between researchers and Maori communities in New Zealand. Because of the influence of environment on heritability, some researchers question the use of adoption studies for assessing the relative influences of genetics and environment on development. These studies compare adopted children to their biological and adoptive parents in an effort to assess the relative impact of heritability. Like plants with constant amounts of nutrients, water, and sunlight, adoptive families share many common features as a result of the screening process required before adopting. Consequently, adoptive parents rarely represent as much diversity as the group of biological parents whose children they adopt. If all adoptive families provide a consistent environment, this factor would inflate the apparent heritability of characteristics examined in their adopted children. The environments provided by adoptive parents are more similar to one another than to the environments provided by biological parents. This environmental similarity can exaggerate genetic influences—a result that must be taken into account when investigating heritability using adopted children. Comparisons of twins are often used in behavioral genetics to evaluate relative contributions of genetics and environment. The differences between identical twins, who share identical DNA, and fraternal twins, whose DNA shows the same approximately 50% of overlap found in any two siblings, are particularly useful because both types of twins share similar environments. The Minnesota Study of Twins Reared Apart (Bouchard, Lykken, McGue, Segal, & Tellegen, 1990) not only compares identical to fraternal twins, but includes pairs of identical twins and fraternal twins adopted at birth and raised in separate homes (see Figure 3.9). Comparisons of identical twins raised together or in separate adoptive families show that some traits are more similar in twin pairs (fingerprint ridge count) than others (nonreligious social attitudes). However, regardless of the degree of similarity for a trait, living apart or together seems to have had relatively little impact on the degree of similarity within twin pairs. In other words, twins raised apart are just about as similar on each trait as twins raised together. Twin studies are also useful in establishing concordance ratesconcordance ratesThe statistical probability that a trait in one person will be shared by another; usually discussed in relation to identical and fraternal twins.

, which are statistical probabilities that a trait observed in one person will be seen in another. Concordance rates are especially useful to psychologists interested in psychological disorders because they provide estimates of the heritability of a condition. For example, concordance rates for autism spectrum disorder (see Chapter 14) are high in identical twins (95.2%) relative to fraternal twins (4.3%;  Nordenbæk, Jørgensen, Kyvik, & Bilenberg, 2014). Because both types of twins share a uterine environment and are exposed to similar parenting, this discrepancy makes a strong argument for the importance of genetic influences on autism spectrum disorder. Our species shares genes for eye color, but combinations of alleles produce many possible shades.

Although we can say that all humans share 100% of their genes, we do not share 100% of our alleles, giving each of us a unique version of the genome. In other words, we all share genes that produce eye color of some sort, but our different combinations of alleles result in a variety of shades. There are at least 3 million DNA variations in the human genome—enough for us to differ from one another in nearly every gene (Plomin & Spinath, 2004). Analyzing variations of DNA in individuals who do or do not have a particular trait of interest, such as an illness or psychological disorder, can help molecular geneticists pinpoint the causes of problems and suggest preventive strategies. A common misunderstanding is the belief that we can identify  a gene for a particular behavior. For example, a recent headline in Time magazine trumpets,  The Genes for Pot Addiction Have Been Identified (Szalavitz, 2016). It is important to remember that genes encode for proteins, not behaviors. Genes build proteins that construct brains, and brains might or might not become addicted to cannabis. Rather than viewing a gene as causing a complex behavior, it is more accurate to view genes as contributing to the development and functioning of the nervous system, which in turn generates observable behavior. Prior to the development of databases made possible by the Human Genome Project and the International HapMap Project, investigating more than a few genes at a time was not feasible. Instead, candidate genecandidate geneA gene that has a greater impact on a trait of interest than other genes.

 research studies were conducted, in which one gene or a small number of genes were compared between groups of people with and without a condition of interest. This search for candidate genes for a particular phenotype, such as schizophrenia, did not result in accurate or complete findings (Farrell et al., 2015). Rather than testing single genes, contemporary functional geneticists often use genomewide association studies (GWAS)genomewide association studies (GWAS)A scan of complete sets of DNA from many participants, which is performed to look for variations associated with a particular phenotype, condition, or disease.

 or whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Emerging technologies now allow researchers to scan complete sets of DNA from many participants, looking for variations associated with a particular phenotype, condition, or disease. When 25 historical candidate genes for schizophrenia were reevaluated using GWAS, effects for 24 of the 25 genes were not confirmed, and 4 genes that had been missed by the candidate gene approach appear to be quite important (Farrell et al., 2015). As our methods for conducting genetic research improve, our answers become more complete and accurate.

Having identical genotypes, as is the case with identical twins, does not guarantee identical phenotypes, or observed characteristics. As we explained in the example of the Agouti gene’s effects on the fur color and weight of baby mice, different phenotypes can result from the same genotype due to interactions between the organism and its environment. When factors other than the genotype produce changes in a phenotype, we say that an epigeneticepigeneticThe study of gene–environment interactions in the production of phenotypes.

 change has occurred. Epi is Greek for  over or  above, so epigenetics refers to the reversible development of traits by factors that determine how genes perform. The field of epigenetics explores these gene–environment interactions. Epigenetic change influences gene expression, the process by which DNA builds proteins that contribute to features of living cells. Genes can be turned on or off by internal signals (hormones or neurochemicals) or by signals from external sources (diet or toxins). There is an obvious need for epigenetics in development, as the differences between a skin cell and a muscle cell result from turning on the right set of genes and turning off others. Thus, the magnitude of epigenetic change depends on an organism’s age. The fetus experiences the highest rate of epigenetic change, followed by the child and finally, the adult. While epigenetic changes are reversible, many last entire lifetimes. For example, individuals who experienced traumatic life events during childhood were found to have long-term epigenetic changes in the hippocampus, a structure associated with memory and responses to stress (Abdolmaleky, Zhou, & Thiagalingam, 2015). Although we have cautioned you against  a gene for reasoning for complex human behaviors, the examination of candidate genes continues to be a viable approach to understanding the  nature part of the nature–nurture interaction (see Figure 3.10). In some cases, identification of candidate genes can have profound influences on public policy. One such candidate gene is the MAOA (monoamine oxidase A) gene, which has been implicated in antisocial behavior. The protein produced by the MAOA gene is an enzyme that affects several important neurochemicals, including dopamine and serotonin, which are discussed further in Chapter 4. Variations in MAOA are classified as low or high activity. The low-activity version has been linked to impulsive antisocial behavior, leading to its popular reputation as  the warrior gene. How valid is this point of view?Low and high activity versions of the MAOA gene interact with the experience of child maltreatment to predict antisocial behavior (Caspi et al., 2002). Here, we see that youth with either allele who are not exposed to child maltreatment have a low risk of being convicted for a violent crime. Youth with histories of probable or known severe maltreatment have a higher risk of being convicted of a violent crime if they also possess the low-activity version rather than the high-activity version of the MAOA gene. An early case study (see Chapter 2) of a Dutch family characterized by an unusual zero-activity version of MAOA and a history of extreme aggression encouraged further investigations of the  warrior gene (Brunner, Nelen, Breakefield, Ropers, & van Oost, 1993). Studies of more typical MAOA alleles, however, demonstrate very small effect sizes. This means that only a small part of the variation in antisocial behavior across the population can be linked to people’s MAOA alleles. Many other factors must play important roles in determining levels of aggressiveness. This has not, however, stopped the legal system from considering MAOA status in criminal cases. Not only has MAOA status been admitted as evidence in the European Union and in the United States, but this information has been used to support the idea that defendants had reduced responsibility for aggressive actions because they  couldn’t help being violent. However, it is also possible that courts of law might administer more stringent punishments, such as longer prison terms, under the belief that the person is relatively untreatable (González-Tapia & Obsuth, 2015). Geneticists and psychologists have a responsibility to communicate the correct interpretation of findings to policymakers in order to avoid improper applications of research results. Among the factors known to produce epigenetic change are nutrition, disease-causing organisms, drugs, stress, and environmental toxins. In particular, malnutrition and stress experienced by pregnant women have the potential to influence the epigenetics of the fetus, leading to lifelong effects on physical and psychological well-being. In the discussion of psychological disorders in Chapter 14, you will see that many disorders trace their roots to a combination of genetic vulnerability and disruptions experienced by the pregnant woman, such as illness or malnourishment. Fraga et al. (2005) studied 160 identical twin pairs between the ages of 3 and 74. The two chromosomes on the left belong to a pair of 3-year-old twins, and those on the right belong to a pair of 50-year-old twins. Areas of red indicate differences between the two chromosomes in each pair related to differences in gene expression. As twins age, their gene expression becomes more different, as indicated by the greater amount of red in the chromosomes from the older twins. Twins who had spent the most time apart showed the greatest epigenetic differences. Geneticists have identified four processes that produce lasting but reversible changes in gene expression: ribonucleic acid (RNA) interference, RNA editing, histone modification, and DNA methylation (see Figure 3.11). For the purposes of this overview, we will focus on histone modification and DNA methylation. Histones are protein structures around which your DNA is wound. If the DNA in a single cell were not wound up in this fashion, it would be over 6 feet long (Annunziato, 2008). When either the core or the tail of a histone interacts with regulatory proteins, the expression of nearby segments of DNA can become more or less likely. DNA methylation occurs when a methyl group (one carbon atom bonded to three hydrogen atoms) is added to the DNA molecule. This has the result of turning genes off. You can think about DNA methylation as being similar to stapling some pages in a book together. Because of the staples, you can’t read the pages. Two processes for producing epigenetic change are histone modification and DNA methylation. Histone modification occurs when certain chemicals interact with the tail or core of a histone. DNA methylation occurs when a methyl group (one carbon atom bonded to three hydrogen atoms) attaches to the DNA molecule. These modifications affect the likelihood that particular genes will be expressed or silenced. We typically think of Nutritionists as providing good advice about what to eat, especially for pregnant women, children buying school lunches, and people facing health challenges. But we also understand that the food we eat is one of the key environmental factors that produce epigenetic change. A new field known as nutrigenomics has emerged to explore the epigenetic influences of diet. In the not-too-distant future, you might be given an individualized diet plan by a nutritionist based on your personal methylation pattern. Although this might initially help us with certain cancers and other disease states, we know that some psychological disorders are also influenced by epigenetics. It is possible that in addition to more conventional treatments, individuals with psychological disorders might benefit from diets tailored to their epigenetic histories. Many common foods have known epigenetic effects. Intake of garlic, broccoli, and dietary fiber can turn on anticancer and other protective genes. We saw earlier in this chapter how mother mice exposed to BPA gave birth to offspring that had yellow fur and were obese due to reduced methylation of the Agouti gene. However, if the mother exposed to BPA was also given a diet rich in the nutrients choline, betaine, and vitamin B12, all of which contribute to increased methylation, the offspring had normal weight and brown fur. We might not be able to control the environmental toxins to which we are exposed, but a greater understanding of epigenetics might help balance our exposure with appropriate nutrition. Although many epigenetic studies examine physical features like fur color, more complex features of interest to psychologists are also subject to epigenetic influences. For example, rats that were licked frequently during infancy by their mothers (the rat equivalent of getting a hug from mom) were calmer when faced with stress later in life than rats licked infrequently (Champagne, Francis, Mar, & Meaney, 2003). By licking their pups, these mothers influenced the expression of genes that determined responses to a stress hormone. The nurture provided by the mother had a lifelong impact on the offspring’s ability to cope with stress. Children exposed to child abuse have been found to have similar long-lasting changes in the expression of genes related to stress hormones (Neigh, Gillespie, & Nemeroff, 2009), as well as a number of genes associated with later medical problems and psychological disorders (Yang et al., 2013). Happily, these changes appear to be reversible in children who experience consistent and responsive caregiving by foster parents (Fisher, Van Ryzin, & Gunnar, 2011). A human being has about 100 trillion meters of DNA. To put this in perspective, this means that our DNA could go to the Sun and back more than 300 times. Epigenetics has the potential to illuminate the causes of many psychological disorders, as discussed in Chapter 14. Hundreds of separate genes appear to be linked to disorders like schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, and bipolar disorder, yet no single gene produces more than a tiny effect on a person’s risk of developing these disorders. In contrast, patterns of DNA methylation and unusual histone modifications are strongly associated with risk for these conditions. For example, epigenetic differences help to distinguish between identical twin pairs in which one twin has schizophrenia or bipolar disorder while the other remains healthy (Abdolmaleky et al., 2015). We have seen in this chapter that individual experience can influence gene expression, but scientists also are considering the possibility that epigenetic changes can be passed along to subsequent generations. How might this happen?Brian Dias and Kerry  Ressler (2014) investigated transgenerational epigenetics using fear conditioning in mice. As explained in Chapter 8, animals (including humans) can learn to associate a signal with an important event through the process of classical conditioning. If a mouse learned to fear an odor associated with shock prior to becoming a parent, could this experience affect the offsprings’ reaction to the odor?The Question: Can a learned fear response to an odor be passed from one generation to the next?Dias and Ressler began by training mice to fear the smell of a chemical called acetophenone, which to us smells like almonds and cherries (see Figure 3.12). After the odor was infused into the mouse’s cage, the mouse experienced electric shock through the grid floor. After sufficient training, the mice showed fear in the presence of the odor, even when they didn’t get shocked. The researchers conditioned fear to another odor in one control group and included another control group that had no fear conditioning at all. According to Dias and Ressler (2013), a changed response to a distinctive odor can be passed to a mouse’s children and grandchildren. A male mouse  is exposed to an odor paired with foot shock. The male offspring of this mouse is tested with a combination of odor and a blast of noise (a standard way of measuring startle). The grandchild of the original mouse is tested the same way. Compared to mice whose fathers and grandfathers did not receive a pairing of odor and foot shock, these mice demonstrated an enhanced startle effect to the odor plus noise, suggesting that a greater sensitivity to the odor might have been passed along due to epigenetic change. All of the mice were mated following conditioning, and their offspring were tested for their reaction to acetophenone. As you learned in Chapter 2, all animal research in psychology is regulated by a set of strict ethical guidelines. The use of electric shock in this experiment must conform to federal regulations regarding pain. Offspring of the father mice receiving the acetophenone–shock pairings showed fear to the acetophenone, even though they had never experienced it. Even more surprisingly, the grandchildren of the original conditioned mice also showed fear of acetophenone, as did mice conceived using in vitro fertilization with sperm from the original trained mice. What could possibly produce this response to an odor that a parent learned to fear? The original trained mice responded to their fear training by increasing the production of a protein related to detecting acetophenone. The researchers suggested that DNA methylation had occurred on the genes responsible for producing the receptor protein. Because the next two generations showed similar changes, the researchers argued that the epigenetic changes were passed along through the sperm by mechanisms that are not fully understood. While some scientists support the conclusions put forward by Dias and Ressler, others are more skeptical. Successful replications and further research on mechanisms of transgenerational epigenetics might clarify the processes responsible for these observations.

Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution described how species change in an orderly manner. The human genome is the product of millions of years of evolutionevolutionDescent with modification from a common ancestor.

, defined by biologists as descent with modification from a common ancestor. The study of evolution allows us to trace the family tree of living things. In his book The Origin of Species, Charles Darwin proposed that species evolve or change from one form to the next in an orderly manner (Darwin, 1859). Darwin was well aware of the procedures used by farmers to develop animals and plants with desirable traits by mating particular individuals. A farmer’s goal to raise the strongest oxen for pulling a plow might be accomplished by breeding the strongest available oxen to each other. In these cases, the farmer is using artificial selection to determine which individuals have the opportunity to produce offspring. Darwin suggested that instead of a farmer making these decisions, the pressures of survival and reproduction in the wild would make the choice, a process that he called natural selectionnatural selectionThe process by which survival and reproduction pressures act to change the frequency of alleles in subsequent generations.

. Organisms that survive long enough to reproduce would pass their traits to the next generation. Organisms that did not reproduce would not have the opportunity to pass their traits to future generations. As geneticists often remind us, we have no infertile ancestors. In the more than 150 years since The Origin of Species was first published, our understanding of genetics and the fossil record has expanded exponentially, lending substantial further support for Darwin’s views. Surprisingly, Darwin was able to derive his theory without the benefit of a basic understanding of genetics. He was unable to account for the variations he observed in a particular trait. That understanding was provided by Gregor Mendel (1822–1884), who discovered ways to predict the inheritance of particular traits, like the color of flowers, in his research on pea plants (Mendel, 1866). Mendel, in turn, was working without our modern understanding of genes. Combining current understanding of genetics with the natural selection processes proposed by Darwin provides scientists with powerful hypotheses about the progression of species over time.

In addition to the process of natural selection described by Darwin, evolution can result from mutation, migration, and genetic drift. A mutationmutationAn error that occurs when DNA is replicated

 is an error that occurs when DNA is replicated. The average human baby is born with about 130 new mutations, but most have no effect (Zimmer, 2009). Mutant alleles providing some advantage spread through the population, but most mutant alleles that result in a disadvantage disappear from future generations. MigrationMigrationMovement to a new location

 occurs when organisms move from one geographical location to the next. Moving to a new location can affect the survival of individuals and the frequency of certain alleles in the population. Phenotypical traits that are advantageous in one environment might be less so in another.

 produces change from one generation to the next through chance or accident. Type B blood is virtually absent in contemporary populations of Native Americans, most likely due to chance (Halverson & Bolnick, 2008). The group of ancestors who first made their way to the Western hemisphere did not include anyone with the Type B allele. If the ancestors’ blood type alleles had been more representative of the entire human population, more of their descendants would have Type B blood. Darwin understood that breeders could influence the traits of offspring by mating particular individuals. He believed that natural selection operated according to the same principles. The pressures of survival and reproduction in the wild would take the role of the breeder—determining which traits are passed to the next generation. We can explore the effects of evolutionary processes—mutation, migration, genetic drift, and natural selection—on the history of one allele: the recessive allele for blond hair. The original appearance of the allele for blond hair was probably the result of a random mutation occurring in northern Europe some 10,000 years ago (Frost, 2006). Migration, or rather the lack of it, might account for the relatively restricted area in northern Europe populated by blondes until fairly recently. Genetic drift undoubtedly reduced the global frequency of the blond allele between 1300 and 1700, as waves of bubonic plague decimated the European population. If by chance every person carrying the blond allele had died from the plague before reproducing, the allele would have disappeared from the human genome (see Figure 3.13). After the first appearance of the blond hair allele about 10,000 years ago as a result of a chance mutation, its frequency might have been affected by migration, genetic drift, and natural selection. Has natural selection influenced the blond gene? Some scientists believe it has. When people have a choice of mates of equal value, they will select the one that stands out from the crowd (Frost, 2006;  Bem, 2001). Therefore, individuals with relatively rare blond hair might have enjoyed more reproductive success than those with more common, darker hair colors (Field et al., 2016). In Germany, with its high percentage of blondes, the trait of blondness is viewed differently than in countries where blondes are relatively rare. German men report that they view blondes as good homemakers, but they find women with dark hair more sexually attractive. Gregor Mendel (1822–1884) made important discoveries about inheritance at about the same time that Darwin was working on his theory of evolution, but neither scientist knew about genes and chromosomes. Modern geneticists combine this knowledge to form powerful hypotheses about the nature of living things. Any consideration of evolution must include the question of what natural selection selects. Natural selection favors the organism with the highest degree of fitnessfitnessThe ability of one genotype to reproduce more successfully relative to other genotypes.

, defined as the ability of one genotype to reproduce relative to other genotypes. The concept of fitness includes survival to adulthood, ability to find a mate, and reproduction. Fitness is not some static characteristic, such as being strongest or fastest. Instead, fitness describes the interaction between characteristics and the environment in which they exist. A genotype that succeeds during the Ice Age may be at a significant disadvantage during periods of warmer temperatures. Animals in cold climates have short legs and stocky bodies, which help retain heat, whereas animals in warm climates have long legs and slim bodies, which release heat. Again, we see the need to consider nature within the context of nurture.

 refers to either the process or the result of change because of natural selection. In other words, a species can respond to an environmental change by adapting, and features of the new phenotype may be called adaptations. Adaptations can take many forms. They can be behaviors, such as jumping higher to better avoid a predator, or anatomical features, such as eyes that can see color. Adaptations do not necessarily produce perfection. Any adaptation that is good enough to contribute to the fitness of an organism will carry forward into future generations. A classic example of rapid adaptation is the case of the English peppered moth (Biston betularia). Before the Industrial Revolution, most peppered moths found in Britain were light gray, which allowed them to hide against the similar colors of tree bark. Darker moths occasionally appeared beginning around 1848, but because they were less capable of hiding from predators, they made up only about 1% of the population. With increasing industrialization, tree bark became frequently coated in soot. The once-camouflaged light gray moths became an easy target for predators against the darker background of the sooty trees. The darker moths rapidly became the norm, reaching frequencies of about 98%. As pollution came under better control, tree bark returned to its original light gray, and the lighter moths again became the norm. The peppered moth population successfully adapted to changing environmental circumstances, with color playing the role of an adaptation. The moths did not  decide to change color. Natural selection, in the form of greater rates of reproductive success on the part of moths with a particular color, changed the frequencies of color alleles within the population. Adaptations often appear to be compromises between costs and benefits. Adult human males have about 10 times as much testosterone as adult human females. Testosterone conveys a reproductive advantage because men with higher testosterone report having more sex partners and earlier age at intercourse (Lassek & Gaulin, 2009). On the negative side, however, high testosterone levels lead to lower immune system functioning, making the high testosterone males more vulnerable to disease (Muehlenbein & Bribiescas, 2005). Adaptation is only one source of evolutionary change. Random events, such as the collision of meteors with the Earth and resulting climate changes, are believed to have destroyed some types of life and provided broad opportunities for others. We are also limited in our ability to use adaptation to predict the future. The study of evolution is similar to the study of history. Although we gain insight into wars by studying the causes of World War II, we cannot use our knowledge to predict future wars with precision. We can be fairly certain that antibiotic-resistant bacteria, climate change, pollution, and reproductive technologies are probably changing the face of the human population as this text goes to press, but where all these changes will lead us remains unknown. Fitness varies across environments. Characteristics like long ears and long legs work in hot, desert climates, but short ears and legs conserve heat in colder climates. The dark and light coloring of the peppered moth population in Great Britain changed in response to pollution from soot that collected on trees and changed again when pollution controls reduced the soot.

Our interest as psychologists is in the mind, and the mind and the behavior that it produces originate in the structures and processes of the brain and nervous system. Nervous systems are fairly recent innovations that separate animals from plants (see Figure 3.14). We can place the origin of the Earth at 4.5 billion years ago and the first single-celled life forms 1 billion years later, but the first neural nets appeared only 700 million years ago. In these primitive animals, the nerves in the abdomen were as likely to be important to behavior as the ones in the head. True brains residing in heads did not appear until animals formed skeletons, around 500 million years ago. The first decidedly human brain made its appearance only 7 million years ago, a small blip in the timeline of evolution (Calvin, 2004). The current model of the human brain has only been available for the last 100,000–200,000 years. If the 4.5-billion-year history of the Earth were expressed as a 24-hour day: The first single-celled organisms would have emerged 18 hours ago. The first nervous systems would have emerged about 3 hours and 45 minutes ago. The first true brain would have emerged about 2 hours and 40 minutes ago. The first hominin brain would have emerged less than 2.5 minutes ago. The current version of the human brain would have emerged less than 3 seconds ago. Anthropologists use the term hominin to describe species that walked on two feet, had large brains, and are assumed to be related to modern humans. Over the 7 million years of hominin evolution, brains grew rapidly, suggesting that improved intelligence was quickly translated into substantial advantages in survival. Early tool-using hominins, the australopithecines, had brains that were about the same size as those of modern chimpanzees, or about. Homo erectus, a hominin living about 1.5 million years ago, had a brain of about nd the brains of modern humans, or Homo sapiens, are about. Males with high testosterone report more chances to reproduce, but testosterone also might lower the response of the immune system. Extremely high levels of testosterone, because of the use of performance-enhancing drugs, might be contributing to the early deaths of some professional wrestlers, like Curt Hennig (1958–2003). Hominins were not the only creatures who evolved large brains and considerable intelligence. The other primates, elephants, and whales are not lacking in these areas. Although the challenges of finding food, avoiding predators, and navigating through territories require considerable intelligence, these ecological challenges are no match for the complexity of social life faced by the hominins. The major factor distinguishing human intelligence from intelligence of other species is the richness and complexity of the social behavior supported by the human brain. Managing the abilities to distinguish friend and foe, imitate the behavior of others, use language to communicate, recognize and anticipate the emotions, thoughts, and behavior of others, maintain relationships, and cooperate required the evolution of a special brain (Cacioppo et al., 2002;  Hrdy, 2005;  Roth & Dicke, 2005). Comparisons of the challenges faced by different species support a stronger role for social complexity than for ecological complexity in building bigger brains (Cacioppo & Decety, 2011a;  Dunbar & Schultz, 2007). Over the course of hominin evolution, the size of the brain increased dramatically. It is possible that the ability of bigger brains to manage social relationships could have driven this rapid change.

You surf the Internet, complete your calculus homework, and read this textbook with a brain that is essentially the same size as that of your early Homo sapiens ancestors. Although we can understand the advantages to survival of big, intelligent brains, we do not know why advances such as agriculture, literacy, and urbanization have not been accompanied by additional increases in brain size. It is possible that we have reached equilibrium between our needs for intelligence and the costs of a big brain. Brains are expensive to run in terms of nutrients. Although the brain comprises only about 2% of the body’s weight, it requires at least 15% of the body’s resources. In addition, brain size may be limited by the dimensions of the birth canal. Further change may not occur unless we experience a drop in the costs of big brains, a change in nutrients, or additional pressures for greater intelligence. Although brain size has changed little during Homo sapiens’s time on the Earth, the evolution of the human brain has not ended, and average intelligence has not remained the same. Modern genetic techniques allow researchers to date changes in a particular gene. Genes involved with brain development appear to have changed as recently as 6,000 years ago (Evans et al., 2004,  2005). As discussed in Chapter 10, IQ test scores have increased dramatically worldwide over the last 100 years (Flynn, 1999). If brain size has not changed for 100,000 years, let alone during the last 100 years, how can we account for the observed increase in intellectual performance? It is likely that environmental factors, including nutrition and education, might explain the improvement. It is somewhat surprising that humans figured out how to go to the Moon and back with brains that were the same size as those of Homo sapiens living 100,000 years ago. ConceptDefinitionExampleNatural selectionA trait’s frequency in a population is determined by the survival and reproductive success of the organisms with the trait. Faster rabbits are more likely to survive and reproduce than slow rabbits, leading to more fast rabbits in subsequent generations. MutationGenetic changes that occur spontaneously or because of external factors like radiationA mutation about 10,000 years ago led to the appearance of blond hair. MigrationPopulations move from one area to another. Moving from a cold to a warm climate might change the natural selection of traits in a species. Genetic driftChance events influence the frequency of alleles. Huntington’s disease is more common than usual among the Afrikaner population of South Africa because a carrier of the disease was among the small number of Dutch immigrants who survived to reproduce. FitnessThe ability of one genotype to reproduce relative to other genotypes in a particular environment. The recessive sickle-cell trait has low fitness in general because it can produce disease, but because the trait protects the individual from malaria, it has higher fitness in populations living where malaria is common. AdaptationEvolutionary changes whereby a population becomes better suited to its environment. The moth population changed from primarily light to dark colors when the trees they inhabited became darker because of pollution.

We mentioned in an earlier section that behavior can be adaptive. If an animal that is good at hiding in the bushes is more successful than others of its species in escaping predators, it is likely that the ability to hide will spread through subsequent generations of the population. Physical features, like the coloring of an animal that allows it to hide, are well-understood types of adaptations. Evolutionary psychologists attempt to explain how behaviors can be adaptive too. Behavior like hiding, however, is unlike the other adaptations discussed so far, such as the color of a moth or blond hair. Color is a physical characteristic, and it is a fairly simple matter to identify the genes associated with these phenotypes. Behavior as a phenotype is considerably more complex. It is not an anatomical structure like a wing or an eye. Can we assume that behavior is shaped by the same evolutionary forces that affect physical traits? Darwin thought so. In The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex, he writes:The difference in mind between man and the higher animals, great as it is, certainly is one of degree and not of kind. We have seen that the senses and intuitions, the various emotions and faculties, such as love, memory, attention, curiosity, imitation, reason, etc., of which man boasts, may be found in an incipient, or even sometimes in a well-developed condition in lower animals. (Darwin, 1871, p. 126)

Among the psychological specialties discussed in Chapter 1, evolutionary psychology, a subspecialty within biological psychology, is the most relevant to our current discussion of the evolution of behavior. This approach to the mind assumes that our current behavior exists in its present form because it provided some advantage in survival and reproduction to our ancestors (Cosmides & Tooby, 1997). The evolutionary psychology approach not only owes an obvious debt to Darwin, but also is a direct descendant of the functionalism supported by William James. As the term functionalism implies, behavior is seen as promoting survival, as opposed to being random and pointless. The goal of evolutionary psychology is to explain how the patterns of behavior that we share with other humans have been shaped by evolution. Predator fish typically hunt on the perimeter of a fish ball, where it is easier to isolate and capture prey. Humans who are on the social perimeter also may be at risk from predation, but usually from their own kind.

Reconstructing the evolution of the nervous system is difficult, and tracing the origins of individual behavior is even more challenging, but identifying the roots of social behavior might be the most difficult task of all. Occasionally, physical evidence has allowed scientists to determine whether dinosaur parents stayed around to look after their young, but such accounts leave much detail unexplored and unexplained. Individuals belonging to social species congregate in a number of ways, from pairs to families to whole societies. Belonging to a social group provides the benefits of mutual protection and assistance. Predatory fish are most likely to hunt in the perimeter of a school of fish because it’s easier to isolate prey there than in the middle of the school (Ioannou, Guttal, & Couzin, 2012). Being on the social perimeter is risky for our species as well. This simple fact of survival might be one of the reasons that we react so emotionally when we believe that we are being socially excluded. Being social carries costs as well as benefits. Social animals face injury in competition for food and mates and are exposed to contagious illnesses (Alexander, 1974), but the benefits of being social have clearly outweighed the costs for many species. In typical environments, individual animals experience a variety of possible interactions when they come into contact with others of their kind. In each case shown in Table 3.3, individuals either benefit or do not benefit from the interaction, ultimately affecting their survival and reproductive success. Both parties benefit equally if they cooperate. For example, two hunters can work together to bring down an animal that neither could successfully hunt alone. Sharing the resulting meat with the families of both hunters would contribute to their survival and reproductive success. Much social behavior probably originated in these types of situations, in which the benefits of cooperation for an individual’s survival and reproduction outweighed the disadvantages of cooperating. And the second organism:The first organism:WinsLosesWinsCooperationSelfishnessLosesAltruismSpiteAlthough no cultures today exist exactly like the hunters–gatherers of the past, the Ache of Paraguay are often used as a model of how that life might have been. Here, the Ache cooperate with one another to fish. Social behaviors like cooperation might have allowed humans, who are not particularly strong individuals, to survive. Cooperation, however, is not the only way that two individuals can interact. In selfish interactions, one person could steal food from another, allowing the thief’s family to survive while the victim’s family starves to death. In spiteful interactions, both participants lose. In some divorce proceedings, the partners are so determined to keep each other from maintaining resources that everything goes to the attorneys.

, one individual’s self-sacrifice is designed to benefit another individual. Altruism, or the sacrifice of yourself for others, is more common among related individuals, but it also occurs when we are in close social contact with others. Honeybees sting to defend their hive, but in doing so, they end their own lives. Altruism is widespread in the animal kingdom. Most of us have experienced a honeybee sting, which is suicidal behavior on the part of the bee in an effort to protect its hive (Wilson, 1975). Altruism can extend to entire social organizations, regardless of the degree of relatedness (Chicago Social Brain Network, 2011). Among emperor penguins (Aptenodytes forsteri), survival of the chicks in the hostile Antarctic cold depends not only on an individual parent, but on the larger huddle formed by other parents. As discussed in greater detail in Chapter 13, altruism is one of the most challenging social behaviors to explain in evolutionary terms. Darwin himself was puzzled by the apparent sacrifice of some individuals that led to the survival of the group. If altruism results in the destruction of the individual with altruistic genes, why doesn’t this behavior disappear? To explain this phenomenon, we return to the concept of relatedness presented earlier in the chapter. Sacrificing your life to save a close blood relative might increase the likelihood that your alleles would be passed along to subsequent generations. Self-sacrifice in this case does not need to be a conscious decision. Any behavior that results in a greater frequency of the relevant genes in subsequent generations will become more common. Cooperation allows humans to carry out complex behaviors that would be impossible for a single individual to perform successfully. You might be thinking that you often behave altruistically toward people who are not related to you. You might have comforted a friend who experienced a death in the family instead of studying for an upcoming midterm.

 was Darwin’s term for the development of traits that help an individual compete for mates (Darwin, 1871). To what extent is human behavior influenced by sexual selection?Survival of emperor penguin chicks in the hostile cold of the Antarctic depends not just on the individual parent, but also on the larger huddle formed by the other parents. Sexual selection is influenced by the different investments in parenting made by males and females (Emlen & Oring, 1977). In many species, including our own, the female bears most costs of reproduction, from the carrying of the developing organism until birth to the nurturance of the young until adulthood. As a result, human females face sharper limitations than human males on the number of children that they can produce in a lifetime. If the goal is to pass your genes to subsequent generations and you are going to produce only one or two children, each child had better be as healthy and well nurtured as possible. The average number of children per woman worldwide dropped dramatically from 4.98 in 1960 to 2.45 in 2014 (The World Bank, 2016; see Figure 3.15). The average number of children per woman worldwide dropped dramatically between 1960 and 2014. Because males have a lower investment of time and resources in reproduction compared to females, it might seem that the best reproductive strategy for males would be promiscuity, but this is not usually the case. In species such as our own, with lengthy and complex development leading to adulthood, a male who abandons his offspring puts their survival at risk (Gibson, 2008). Even if a man fathers many children, his genes are less likely to make it into the next generation if most or all perish from lack of care or protection. The mother can maximize her children’s chances of survival by choosing a father who will not only pass along healthy genes, but also participate in the raising of children. Women have the ability to make accurate predictions of a man’s interest in children simply by looking at a photograph of his face (Roney, Hanson, Durante, & Maestripieri, 2006). Men with facial features correlated with high testosterone (strong brow ridge, square chin) are viewed as less likely to participate in childrearing than are men with facial features correlated with lower testosterone. These results suggest that women would be able to determine a man’s potential as a father before reproductive investment occurs. Earlier in this chapter, we discussed how blond hair might have provided a reproductive advantage because its relative novelty made it an attractive feature. What other types of human traits appear to fit Darwin’s ideas about sexual selection?Genghis Khan may have been the most prolific human male in history. His distinctive Y chromosome has been identified in 16 million living men, or 0.5% of the world’s current total (Zerjal et al., 2003). Sexual selection might occur in two ways. In intrasexual selection (intra means  within), members of one sex compete with one another for access to the other sex. In some species, such as deer, males engage in fights that determine which males are allowed to mate and which are not. Features like large antlers, which assist in winning a fight, could become sexually selected. In intersexual selection (inter means  between), characteristics of one sex that attract the other might become sexually selected. The male peacock’s luxurious tail appears to have developed for the sole purpose of attracting mates. Evolutionary psychologists have argued that a number of human traits might have been subjected to sexual selection, including humor and vocabulary. According to this argument, human males use humor (Cherkas, Hochberg, MacGregor, Snieder, & Spector, 2000) and their vocabularies (Rosenberg & Tunney, 2008) to impress females with their intelligence because of intersexual selection. In romantic situations, males use more uncommon words than they do in other situations. We can also tell you about one behavior that does not successfully attract females—taking unnecessary risks (Wilke, Hutchinson, Todd, & Kruger, 2006). However, risky activities might have indirect positive outcomes for males. Dominant, successful males are likely to attract more females, and dominance among males is often decided on the basis of intrasexual competition in risky endeavors. Women show the ability to predict a man’s score on the Infant Interest Questionnaire, which might indicate how involved a father he would be, by detecting the influence of testosterone on his facial features. The face at the top indicates higher testosterone, while the one at the bottom indicates lower testosterone.

Not only are human societies directly influenced by our biological history, but they also bear the stamp of the inventions of the biological brain in the form of culture. Cultures, which arise from socially transmitted knowledge, provide practices, values, and goals that can be shared by groups of people. Languages, morality, arts, laws, and customs make up a diverse and vibrant part of human social interactions. Experiences shaped by culture, like other types of experiences, interact with survival and reproductive pressures. How might cultural differences have affected our ancestors’ survival? We can gain insight into our species’ cultural history by observing contemporary preagricultural societies, such as the Waorani and Yanomamö of the Amazon Basin. These groups are remarkably combative. Fights between villages account for 30% of the deaths among Yanomamö males (Chagnon, 1988) and 54% of deaths among Waorani males (Beckerman et al., 2009). Cultural traditions in the two groups have led to different patterns of interactions between aggression and reproductive success. Aggressive Yanomamö men produce more children than less aggressive Yanomamö, but less aggressive Waorani men have more surviving offspring than aggressive Waorani (Beckerman et al., 2009). A simple cultural distinction—the Yanomamö practice of standing down for a period of time between raids, which is not a practice shared by the Waorani—appears to account for the differences observed in the impact of aggression on reproductive success. Our social minds were shaped by the cultures of hunter–gatherer groups until the development of agriculture approximately 10,000 years ago. With improved control of the food supply, less geographical mobility, and larger communities, humans entered a new era of social interaction. Although we believe that many features found in modern human behavior, such as reciprocal altruism, originated in the hunter–gatherer society, further social adjustments were required as groups became larger and more complex. Agriculture, with its emphasis on land ownership, might have been the origin of patriarchal systems, in which men maintain control of resources, and inheritances follow the male line. Unlike hunter–gatherer societies, which are relatively egalitarian so far as the rights of men and women go, agricultural societies tilted the control of food and important resources in favor of men. Early industrialization merely built upon agricultural systems and, if possible, accentuated the power differential between males and females. Contemporary trends are again moving in a more egalitarian direction, with women in developed countries enjoying considerable financial independence and reproductive choice. These changes will no doubt have further effects on our social environment. The Waorani (left) and Yanomamö (right) of the Amazon Basin share high rates of aggression and yet experience different reproductive outcomes. Reproductive success is higher among the most aggressive Yanomamö and the least aggressive Waorani. This outcome is probably the result of the Yanomamö practice, not shared by the Waorani, of standing down between raids. This gives aggressive Yanomamö men chances to rest, heal, and reproduce that are not available to aggressive Waorani men. As societies became larger, humans took advantage of their large brains to devise new cultural systems to maintain group cohesion. Emerging societies shared many of the same types of internal conflict, so we typically find similar moral, religious, and legal systems across diverse cultures that attempt to control marriage,  character issues such as honesty, and the transfer of precious resources. With all the flaws of our groups, whether we’re looking at families, communities, or nations, we retain a strong need to belong. As we will see on many occasions in this textbook, humans do not thrive in isolation. Our dependence on kinship, friendship, and group membership, honed over the course of 100,000 years or more of social living, continues to influence our behavior today. Humans have developed a strong need to belong and often adopt traditions that enhance a sense of group membership. The development of agriculture 10,000 years ago changed the shape of human cultures. A Cluster of genes known as the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) appears to be subject to sexual selection (Wedekind & Füri, 1997). As described in this chapter, this type of sexual selection operates on traits in one sex that influence the choices by the other. A child with a heterozygous set of MHC genes is better prepared to battle infections than is a child with MHC genes that are similar to one another. As a result, our children are more likely to survive if we select a mate that has a different set of MHC genes than we do. There is some evidence that too much MHC similarity affects not just our children, but also our relationships. Garver-Apgar et al. (2006) reported that among romantic couples, increases in the number of MHC alleles shared by a couple reduced the woman’s sexual responsivity to her partner and increased her number of extrapair sexual partners and her attraction to men other than her partner. In a world before genetic testing, it appears that we were able to select partners with compatible MHC profiles on the basis of odor. Different configurations of the MHC genes produce distinctive body odors. When participants were asked to rate the pleasantness of the odors of T-shirts that had been worn by other people, they preferred smells associated with MHC genotypes that were different from their own (Wedekind & Füri, 1997). Instead of relying on smell, some people are taking advantage of relatively affordable genetic testing to assess their relationships. Instant Chemistry provides clients and their partners with information about genes related to immune function, serotonin transport, oxytocin receptors, and dopamine function. It is too soon to tell whether such endeavors will improve relationships. We hope that you will use the critical thinking skills discussed in Chapter 2 to evaluate Instant Chemistry’s claim that they  can help give you insights into how your relationship ticks and where strengths and weaknesses may lie ( Instant Chemistry Uses Biological and Psychological Factors, 2017). Participants in a study preferred the smell of T-shirts worn by people who have MHC genotypes different from their own. Historically, these smell preferences might have helped people select partners with whom they are most likely to have healthy children. What can we learn about our cyberbullying problem by incorporating research about genetics?Several researchers have identified interactions between genes and the experience of bullying that influence a victim’s outcomes (see Figure 3.16). Variations in the serotonin transporter gene (SERT) interacted with the frequency of being bullied to predict the extent of emotional disturbances in youth (Sugden et al., 2010). Having a  risk allele of the FKBP5 gene, which influences the development of stress-related glucocorticoid receptors, interacted with the experience of bullying to predict negative mood, adverse reactions to social stress, and problems with perceiving reality in youth (Cristóbal-Narváez et al., 2016). The risk alleles appear to increase a person’s sensitivity to repeated social defeat, such as being victimized by bullies. Childhood emotional problems become more common when a child experiences frequent, not occasional, bullying, especially when the child has the SS genotype for the serotonin transporter gene. Understanding that some people are more vulnerable to the adverse effects of being bullied might help us identify youth at risk and provide appropriate interventions to help them cope. But what can genetics tell us about the people doing the bullying? Bullies in general, and cyberbullies in particular, share what are known as the Dark Triad of personality traits: Machiavellianism (manipulates others), narcissism (feelings of superiority and entitlement), and psychopathy (lacking empathy) (Goodboy & Martin, 2015). The Dark Triad traits, like all personality traits, are somewhat heritable (Vernon, Villani, Vickers, & Harris, 2008). Do we see the same evidence for gene–environment interactions for these traits as we do in the case of victims of bullying? It is likely that many environmental influences interact with basic genetic predispositions to these traits, including the quality of parenting (Jonason, Lyons, & Bethell, 2014). Others see Dark Triad traits as shaped by evolution to cope with harsh and unpredictable environments (Jonason, Icho, & Ireland, 2016). Because Dark Triad traits resulted in greater survival in certain environmental niches, the traits remain in our contemporary population. In other words, bullies happen. Understanding the nature of bullies and their victims does not lead directly to a solution to the cyberbullying problem, but it might serve as a starting point. We can recognize, at least, that individuals do not have an equal likelihood of becoming bullies and that not all of those who are bullied will react the same way.
